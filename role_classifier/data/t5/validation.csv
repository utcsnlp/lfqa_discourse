"Why does f.m. radio sound pretty good and a.m. sound like it's coming to us live from the 1920s? [1] Because FM is a newer and better technology: [2] Imagine the radio waves are light. [3] AM transmits by changing the brightness of a light (Amplitude Modulation), FM transmits by changing the colour of the light (Frequency Modulation). [4] If you have a clear view of both lights then they both sound good, but imagine if you're driving and trees get in the way of the light beam. [5] You can still see the light through the leaves, but not as well. [6] With AM the brightness of the light keeps changing as leaves block it so the volume keeps going up and down. [7] With FM it doesn't matter how bright the light is because you only care about the colour, which doesn't change. [8] The reason you still have AM as well as FM because AM is much cheaper to broadcast and the signals travel further.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer - Example [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example [8] Auxiliary Information
"How can we take a picture of the milky way if we're located in the milky way? [1] Same way you can take a picture of your house while standing inside your house. [2] Of course, what you can photograph of your house while you are inside your house is rather limited. [3] In the same way, what you can photograph of the Milky Way while inside the Milky Way is also limited, but at least the ""walls"" are largely transparent, so you can see much more than one room. [4] Continue the analogy with a transparent city: you can see the bathroom, you can see the garage, you can see the kitchen (but your view is obscured by the fireplace and the furnace and the water heater), you can also see into and *through* the neighbors' houses (but not through their fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters), you can see way up and down and *through* the block (except through fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters), you can see all over and *through* the city (except for fireplaces, furnaces, water heaters, sewers, water and power systems). [5] Much is obscured, but much more is transparent. [6] And different parts of the city are transparent to different kinds of light, so what you can't see because of all the water heaters in visible light you might see in, say, ultraviolet light. [7] Plot the positions of all these details carefully, and you could still come up with a pretty good map of your city.

"Why does diarrhea feel hotter than normal poop? [1] Your body feels the transfer of heat not really temperature. [2] Diarrhea is mostly water and water has a high convection coefficient, meaning it transfers heat faster. [3] Think of it the same effect as biting into a really hot pizza, the cheese burns you more than the crust. [4] They're both at the same temperature but cheese transfers heat faster. [5] Also, water has high heat capacity, so for every degree of temperature, it has a lot more heat. [6] Regular feces doesn't have as much water in it so it doesn't transfer as much heat as quickly, that's why diarrhea feels hotter. [7] Really, no matter what comes out of you, it's at body temperature. [8] **TL;DR: Diarrhea is the same temperature as regular feces 98.6F/37C but it transfers heat quicker because it's mostly water so it feels hotter.* [9] ** [10] Edit: for clarity. [11] Edit2: Everyone keeps mentioning acidic diarrhea causing this sensation. [12] What I describe above is why it feels *hotter* not *burning*. [13] The burning feeling is from digestive enzymes, though completely different and distinct when compared to the warmer feeling of shooting liquid out your behind. [14] Also, one thing I neglected to mention, mostly for simplicity, is that it's not just the convection coefficient of water that helps the transfer of heat happen quicker but also the fact that it is liquid vs solid. [15] Liquids cover more surface area, therefore can transfer that heat quicker.",[1] Answer [2] Answer [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer [6] Answer [7] Auxiliary Information [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Miscellaneous [10] Miscellaneous [11] Miscellaneous [12] Miscellaneous [13] Auxiliary Information [14] Answer [15] Answer
"What if? The privatization of water. [1] If water becomes privatized basically it becomes a commodity like shoes, clothing brands, cars, etc. [2] Only those who can afford it will have access. [3] Now this isn't a big deal for most commodities, if you can't afford a pair of Nikes there is a cheap brand, knock off or warehouse sales for clothes, public transportation if you don't have a car but water is pretty different as it is literally essential to a healthy life, or any life at all for that matter. [4] If water becomes privatized, it might not be an issue for 1st world citizens like us at first, though privatized water systems have infrastructure issues, most people would still be able to afford it at first though. [5] In third world countries though, and eventually in 1st world, there will come a time where not everyone will be given access to water and this is when things will turn bad. [6] I truly think that water will be the focus of some major conflicts in the relatively near future. [7] This isn't some comfort issue, this isn't some superfluous need, this is water.

"Why does the severe weather alert system that broadcasts over your television sound like I'm logging on to the internet in the 90's? [1] It's actually quite intentional. [2] The Emergency Alert System is designed to be broadcast in case of any emergency, whether it's a weather alert or a Presidential Alert. [3] The system doesn't differentiate where the signal is sent, and is broadcast nationally for each alert, but you don't see the ones that don't apply to you because of those tones at the beginning of the broadcast. [4] The first time the modem noise is played, the EAS is broadcasting information about the affected area, the type of alert, and the originator to the EAS device located at the station. [5] This code is then repeated two additional times in order to ensure that the data was correctly interpreted on the receiving end. [6] The receiver at the broadcast station reads this data, determines automatically if the alert is valid for the broadcast area, and cuts into whatever is playing in order to relay the information. [7] This is the same principal as the handshake your modem used to connect to the internet, but with different data since certain things are assumed (Baud rate, transmission format, frequency, etc.) [8] The three tones at the end of the EAS broadcast are the ""End of Message"" tones. [9] TL;dr: [10] It's because the alerts are sent by a system that's pretty close to a modem.

"Why do bacteria build resistance to antibiotics, but not to things like alcohol, bleach, and boiling? [1] Antibiotics work to stop a particular bacterial process - say making proteins or building a cell wall. [2] This is very specific to the bacteria in question, and will not harm you when you take them. [3] But that means the bacteria can invent ways to become resistant, such as pumping the antibiotic out of their cells or producing a protein that breaks down the antibiotic outside the cell. [4] Alcohol, bleach and boiling are non-specific. [5] They destroy multiple systems in the bacteria. [6] They also destroy your cells.

"Why do so many businesses use computer programs that look like MS-DOS? [1] Changing a business computer system is like rebuilding your house while you're still living in it. [2] It seems like a good idea at the time, so you start building new walls around the outside of your house. [3] Then when you get about halfway finished your wife gets pregnant and now you have to work an extra bedroom into the new house. [4] So you move something here and alter something there and you can just about get a new bedroom in. [5] But now the house will cost more and it'll take a few more months to get done. [6] So your wife now decides that since the new house won't be ready in time she needs to have a new kitchen in the old house, so you stop building the new house and put in a new kitchen. [7] But now you see some benefits to the new kitchen, so you change your plans and tweak some things so maybe you can use bits of your new kitchen in the new house. [8] And then solar panels become a thing, so you decide you want them, which means redoing the roof. [9] And then you get a promotion at work and a company car (this is akin to a business getting a new client who works a bit differently from the old clients) so you need to build a garage. [10] And then you stand back having lost some weight and lost some hair, and realise that there wasn't anything really wrong with the old house in the first place, it just needed a bit of attention here and there. [11] But now you have a mish-mash of old house and new house, and the garage is in the pool, and the nursery is nowhere near the main bedroom, and the kitchen is half upstairs and half downstairs, but at least the roof doesn't leak and you still have cable.

[3] The noise you hear in the movies is not representative of the average silenced weapon, but is a plot device to let bad (or good) guys do their job steathily.

[5] Tldr: Your brain has established cycles for deep sleep, but various factors can affect how much actual sleep you get (ex. [6] Food, drugs, dreams, position, good old genetics) [7] Edit: it's also worthwhile to note, you used uncomfortable position as your example.

"why green laser pointers cost only a few dollars more than red laser pointer but green self-leveling laser levels cost hundreds of dollars more than their red counterparts [1] Not my answer but an answer I found on a forum from 2004. [2] > [3] In a 640nm red laser pointer, there's a red-emitting diode and a lens to collimate (focus) the beam. [4] > [5] In a 532nm green laser (pointer or larger size), there's a BIG infrared laser diode that generates laser light at 808nm, this is fired into a crystal containing the rare-earth element ""neodymium"". [6] This crystal takes the 808nm infrared light and lases at 1064nm (yes, deeper in the infrared!). [7] This 1064nm laser light comes out of the NdYV04 (neodymium yttrium vanadium oxide) crystal and is then shot into a second crystal (containing potassium, titanium,  & amp; phosphorus, usually called KTP) that doubles the frequency to 532nm - the bright green color you see. [8] This light is then collimated (focused) by a lens and emerges out the laser's ""business end"". [9] Just before the lens, there's a filter that removes any stray IR (infrared) rays from the pump diode and the neodymium crystal. [10] Basically, with green diode laser pointers there are lots of itty bitty parts, and they all need to be aligned by hand. [11] If the polarisation is ""off"", one or both crystals need to be turned. [12] The overall process of making and the parts make the green one more expensive. [13] With red diode lasers, you just slap in the diode and slap a lens in front of it, which makes it cheaper. [14] You can also see an image [here](_URL_0_) which more or less shows how the green laser pointer is more complex.",[1] Miscellaneous [2] Miscellaneous [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Miscellaneous [5] Answer [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Answer [8] Auxiliary Information [9] Answer [10] Answer [11] Answer [12] Answer (Summary) [13] Answer (Summary) [14] Miscellaneous

"How do hundreds of animators work together on the same project file when making a big budget animated movie? [1] You don't usually work on the same files because everything is split up between the departments. [2] I haven't used USD yet but I have encountered the following workflow in different studios (using Maya). [3] For example: a character that has been rigged by one (or more, but not at the same time) rigger goes to the animators. [4] Every animator works with the same character rig BUT each animator works on his/her own shot. [5] He/She references (or ""links"") the rig into their scene so that any change that is later made to the rig can be updated in the animators' scenes as well. [6] The environment of that scene is usually a rough blockout, done in the modeling department. [7] It contains all the objects the animator needs to set up and let the character act in his/her shot. [8] Then the scene gets switched out with the final scene (with textures, shading, lights and details) and the character rig is often updated as well, to get any dynamic stuff like hair, cloth and the hires render meshes in there. [9] This is often done in separate departments as well, depending on the size of the studio. [10] This is my simple depiction of the process and it varies from studio to studio.

"How did we decide how long a second was? [1] The Egyptians were the first to split the full cycle of day and night up into 24 hours, a system that was later improved upon by Greek astronomers Ptolemy and Hipparchus who further split it up in a sexagesimal (60 as a base) system, and that's where the second comes into play. [2] First you divide an hour into 60 parts, creating the minute, and then you divide that a *second* time, hence the name, creating 1/60th of a minute. [3] Further splitting up a second in sixthieths is called a third, but that's not really used nowadays. [4] At the time it wasn't possible to keep time that accurate, but towards the end of the 16th century mechanical clocks were able to measure seconds accurately, which is also when the English word for them came into use. [5] **Edit: Since so many people ask ""Why use 60 as a base?"", the answer is because it's easy to divide it by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12 15, 20 and 30, making it a solid base for counting.**",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer

"How do bugs in games occur? [1] Hallo, Computer Scientist here. [2] Bugs are almost never typos, they can be, but this is rarely the case as if you just misspell a variable, for example, your code simply won't compile. [3] Basically, you push Go! and the computer just laughs at you in this case. [4] More often in any kind of software, not just games mind you, the code interacts in a way that the programmer didn't expect. [5] For example, the programmer thought that some variable, X, could _never_ be a negative number. [6] Then, when the code (game, in our case) is running, it ends up being a negative number, and the code interacts in a way the programmer never expected it to. [7] This normally happens at a large level because several, if not dozens or even hundreds, of programmers are all writing on the same code, meaning they cannot possibly account for every single thing that could go wrong. [8] Consider that your average major title, like GTA, Skyrim, etc, can be hundreds of thousands, if not _millions_ of lines of code. [9] It's easy for something to go wrong.

"Why do people sometimes get very giddy/laugh uncontrollably after nearly dying? [1] That's a common side effect of the fight-or-flight response. [2] When you're suddenly in a dangerous situation like an incoming car or an animal attack, your brain sends signals to your adrenal glands (little lumpy bits on top of your kidneys) to start producing various hormones, such as adrenaline and dopamine. [3] When that happens, your heart rate increases, your pupils dilate, your hearing is muffled, your digestive system slows down, and your muscles start burning energy faster, all so you can focus on either defending yourself or running away without having to stop and think about it. [4] Of course having all those hormones suddenly flooding into your system has side effects, one of them being giddiness/laughing. [5] This is likely caused by the hormone dopamine. [6] It's typically produced when you feel pleasure, but also when you feel pain (physical and emotional), to help suppress it and calm you down.
