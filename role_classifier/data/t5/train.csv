"How come Obama during his supermajority in both houses wasn't able to pass any legislation he wanted? [1] 1) Senators are normally seated in January. [2] The race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman was very close (~300 votes). [3] This led to recounts, which led to lawsuits, which led to more recounts. [4] Al Franken (who would've been #60) was not seated until July 7. [5] 2) Ted Kennedy was dying and had not cast a vote since April 2009 or so. [6] After he died in August 2009, he was replaced by Paul G. Kirk until a special election could be held. [7] Due to more lawsuits, Paul G Kirk served from  Sept 24 2009 to February 4 2010.

"Why are there so many fire doors that aren't allowed for regular use? [1] Limiting access to emergency stairwells should ensure that they are in the proper condition to be used in an emergency. [2] There is often a concern in places like a university or a hospital that people will congregate in stairwells. [3] Either to do something they are not supposed to do, or for whatever reason people seem to love stairs. [4] Seldom used stairwells can become a prime place for storing old furniture or other equipment that makes evacuation hazardous when there is a real emergency. [5] Additionally, many emergency fire doors lead to parts of a building that are not designed for regular access. [6] (I am looking at a fire door that leads to a creepy underground tunnel which terminates in an alley two blocks from the building. [7] I would not want random people walking through that door thinking they are going directly out to the street and then getting lost in the emergency egress tunnel.) [8] Underlying your question is another question, why do buildings need so many otherwise useless fire exits? [9] Large institutional fires are horrific, and the death toll often results from lack of access to means of egress. [10] If you have a fire in your building, you want as few wrongful death lawsuits as possible, the easiest way to save people (other than not having any fires, which is attempted though less obvious then fire doors), is having lots of visible means of safe exit.

"Why is the sky blue? [1] The white light from the sun consists of all different colors (wavelengths). [2] When it enters the atmosphere, the light is scattered by particles in the air.

"What is the story behind the Bundy vs. BLM standoff? [1] In 1993, to protect the desert tortoise which was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, the BLM modified the terms of Bundy’s cattle grazing agreement. [2] Bundy refused to comply with the new terms, so the BLM cancelled his permit. [3] Bundy stopped paying the grazing fees, but continued to let his animals roam the public lands, claiming an ancestral right to the land based on his Mormon family settling there in the 19th century and his belief that federal authority doesn't apply to state land(s). [4] As part of an effort to further protect the tortoise, Clark County (NV) purchased all of the active grazing permits in the area and closed it to grazing. [5] Despite him no longer having a valid legal claim, the government offered Bundy compensation, for water rights and range improvements, for his previously held grazing permit. [6] He rejected the offer and left his cattle out there. [7] The government finally had enough and started rounding up his cattle to move them off of the closed land. [8] Bundy claimed the government was taking away his freedom and a bunch of Tea Party nuts showed up to support him with semi-automatic weapons. [9] The BLM, outnumbered and outgunned, told the protesters that they had to stay within certain 'First Amendment' areas to stage their protests.

"What happens when we jam a finger? [1] Maybe it means something different where I'm from, but I've only heard of jamming a finger when specifically referring to the injury (most commonly occurring in sports) where your finger is ""jammed"" into the joint and feels like it needs to be popped back out. [2] That usually signifies a partial dislocation of the joint, also known as subluxation. [3] When it pops back into place, that's called a reduction of the joint. [4] It hurts like hell when it's subluxed because the misaligment causes increased tension (straining) or tearing (spraining) of the ligaments connecting the two bone segments. [5] When it's reduced, it feels better because the tension is relieved, but the strained/sprained ligaments can continue to be sore for a few weeks while they heal. [6] Reducing the joint on your own is generally advised against because pulling on the finger can do more harm than good, e.g. turning a partial tear into a complete tear, which will then require surgery, and also because these injuries can often be accompanied by a fracture.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information,2dc2uq,cjooivw,"[1] Answer,Auxiliary Information,Miscellaneous [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer,Auxiliary Information [4] Answer,Answer (Summary) [5] Answer,Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information"

"If you bear a resemblance with a stranger, are they more closely related to you than other strangers are? [1] Your appearance is defined by multiple genes and multiple pathways. [2] For example you can share a similar face through inheriting different set of genes. [3] So ""external"" similarity doesn't necessarily imply shared ancestry. [4] Height for example is a multifactorial trait which depends among other things on nutrition, it's hard to say you **aren't** related to someone because he/she hasn't the same height. [5] Other backdraw, since you inherit half of your genetic material from one of your parents it's hard to trace certain traits like ""oh he has that kind of nose or hair* we have something in common"" (without having the pedigree of both subjects you are comparing). [6] Maybe he inherited those traits from a russian father while you got them thanks to your irish mother instead of your russian father. [7] Also, -broadly speaking- the same genes are present in most of the populations or ethnicities, the diversity is derived from the frequency of said alleles (or variants within the genes) within the populations. [8] In such way the sampling ~~bias~~ might affect your conclusions (If by chance you are in front of one of the few redhead from population X that hasn't anything to do with a shared origin with that subject). [9] **Edit #2** There is no huge amount of genes that determine the physical appearance. [10] And said gene/traits are the blank of strong sexual selection (let's say you prefer wide hips now). [11] You are going to try to find a mate with wide hips regardless her ancestry whether she is from irish, italian or spanish ancestry (yeah I picked an actual example that could occur in my city/country). [12] Then in a matter of few generations said traits are diluted or detached of some signal of ancestry (yeah you can actually say those hips look like someone from South America but that is all the ""geographical context"" you can provide or infer). [13] No matter how long you are going to trace the problem or lineages the example works, I could have picked African descendants, or from Colombia for that matter and only think at a different scale.

"why do pimples (zits) on the inside of your nostrils hurt so much more than any others? [1] Real answer: [2] The tissue inside your nose isn't very thick and has tons of specialized nerve cells right at the surface, which means that when a pore swells with infection (a zit), the skin is pulled tight and the pressure under the already thin tight skin pushes against all those nerves, causing signals to fire and increasing the painful sensation.

"Why does human genitalia differ so much in size between individuals when compared to other body parts? [1] Genetically, our collective evolution led to some significant constants.

[4] Guy A has a 4-incher, guy B has a 6-incher... so? [5] They aren't using that thing to find a mate. [6] Since women have held less power historically, they couldn't really *choose* what guy they wanted per se - and even if they could, we have no idea whether penis size was something they were really interested in. [7] So unless your penis was basically unusable (either too small or too big to insert semen into a woman) your penis genes survived just like everyone else's.

"How come people don't borrow from low-interest rate countries like Japan and deposit it in high-interest rate countries like Argentina? [1] Victor, this occurs regularly, although it is difficult for individual investors to do. [2] The trade you are discussing has happened in the past, and is likely happening today. [3] In finance parlance, this is known as a carry trade. [4] The best known carry trade was in the 90's, going short (selling, or owing) the Japanese yen and going long (buying, or owning) the US dollar. [5] The key to the carry trade is exactly what you described. [6] It is not simply a matter of being short one currency and long another, but it is being short one currency and long another with a view towards profiting off of the interest rate differentials. [7] In the JPY/USD example, you would be selling JPY that had interest rates of near 0% and buying the USD with interest rates of near 5%. [8] So, you are paying a near 0% interest rate per year towards people you owed JPY, but receiving a 5% interest rate per year from your ownership of USD. [9] If, on a relative basis, the JPY appreciates (gets more expensive) by 5% or more per year, you would lose money as this would wipe out your gains from the interest rate differential. [10] If the currency moves the other way, with JPY getting cheaper relative to USD, you could stand to make a lot of money this way. [11] If the currencies remain flat, on a relative basis, you would be pocketing the 5% per year interest rate differential. [12] One of the reasons this is hard for individuals to do is that you are unlikely able to borrow at headline interest rates unless you have sizable banking relationships. [13] In addition, there are numerous risks, including currency exchange rate movements (one currency getting cheaper or more expensive relative to the other), interest rate changes (thus removing the positive interest rate differential you are gaining), among others.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Example [5] Miscellaneous [6] Answer [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer - Example [9] Answer - Example [10] Answer - Example [11] Answer - Example [12] Answer (Summary) [13] Answer (Summary),2umsnl,co9y9wt,"[1] Answer,Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Auxiliary Information [3] Answer,Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer,Auxiliary Information,Miscellaneous [6] Answer,Auxiliary Information [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer - Example [9] Answer - Example [10] Answer - Example [11] Answer - Example [12] Answer,Answer (Summary) [13] Answer,Answer (Summary)"

"Why is Scientology, with its heavy cult-like status, still allowed to carry on as a religion? [1] In the USA we're protected to freely assemble for any reason so long as it's peaceful.

"How do automatic guns deal with the heat that would be created from the friction of so many bullets passing through the barrel so quickly? [1] Some automatic guns, typically machine guns, have replaceable barrels that are meant to be interchanged when they overheat. [2] Some older machine guns were even water-cooled, or had rotating barrels that would share the thermal load (i.e. the classic Gatling gun). [3] Otherwise, the barrels are just kept well ventilated so that airflow will cool them off.

"There is no archeological evidence that dragons ever existed. So, if they're simply imagined, how is it that they're present in almost every major culture and depicted so similarly? [1] There are certain things that are common in human mythology, and one of them is that humans are predisposed to be impressed by really big things. [2] And it's easier to imagine a really big version of something that already exists than to design something completely from scratch. [3] Hence why so many cultures have stories of giant humans running around. [4] This applies to other creatures as well; take a reptile of some sort, scale it up to being bigger than a house, and suddenly you've got a dragon of some kind. [5] Imagination adds other embellishments such as horns or breathing fire, or whatever the local variation is. [6] (And they can be pretty varied; consider the differences between a standard European dragon, a Chinese dragon, and the Aztec winged serpent -- but they're all basically big lizards.)

"What is the difference between refresh/motion rate and processing rate? [1] Processing rate is sometimes used interchangeably with Refresh Rate (i.e. [2] referring either to how many frames are processed per second or how many times the display/monitor refreshes per second). [3] In terms of refresh rates for games, it's almost always 'the higher the better'. [4] The higher the frame-rate and refresh-rate, the smoother the motion and the more immersive the gaming experience will be. [5] Also, it will potentially allow you to predict motion trajectories better (i.e. [6] make better guesses about where an object/character will be a moment later if it continues on the same path/trajectory). [7] Other times, processing rate may refer to Display Lag (aka Input Lag). [8] This is the amount of time it takes from the moment a signal (i.e. [9] image/frame) gets passed as input to the TV/Monitor and the moment the image/frame is actually displayed on the screen. [10] Modern day TVs and monitors often process the input signal/image for enhancement before displaying the image on the screen. [11] This creates a small delay that is imperceptible when watching content like videos/movies, but can potentially disrupt or otherwise hinder your gaming performance.

"Why is frying a frozen turkey dangerous? [1] All good answers here! [2] I'll add one more thing...when you have a thawed turkey, you dry it off very well before you put it in hot oil. [3] It's not possible to ""dry"" a frozen turkey because a lot of the water is in the form of ice crystals. [4] When ice hits hot oil, it vaporizes. [5] This can cause the oil to splash, and catch on fire. [6] HOWEVER, if there's enough ice crystals, all turning to steam at once...this actually generates propulsion (from a lot of steam trying to escape the oil at once) and can propel your turkey out of the fryer like a cannonball.

"How doesn't the ISS get hit with meteors during showers like the one this week? [1] I actually do this for a living! [2] The basic answer is that space is so big you don't have to worry so much about impacts.

"Why is it such a concern when Russia fights ISIS in the middle east but when the US do it(along with other things in the area), no one gives a damn. [1] Because it challenges U.S. hegemony. [2] The United States likes to try to control areas with instability, because gaining footholds increases their scope, influence, and power. [3] During the cold war, the United States was incredibly concerned about the influence of communism over the rest of the world, because it is at odds with capitalism and the United States way of life. [4] The Soviet Union's brand of totalitarianism just didn't fit with the United State's brand of totalitarianism. [5] After the U.S. ""won"" the cold war, the Russian bear went dormant and struggled to find itself and it's place in world domination. [6] Now-a-days, the bear is trying to spread its wings, and this challenges the domination the United States has over the rest of the world. [7] Unstable Middle Eastern and African regions are supposed to be controlled by the United States, and any intrusion into that control is going to be met with hostility. [8] So in summary, it's basically about the U.S. controlling the world, and having that control challenged. [9] Areas of instability are areas of economic opportunity for the United States, both government and corporate entities. [10] If the United States can establish a dominant presence in a region, they can sell military equipment, and McDonald's to the fledgling beta powers in those regions. [11] Russia getting involved in Syria is like Burger King getting their shit together and putting out a decent burger, and promoting the hell out of it. [12] They're bombing the people that are like the United State's McDonalds marketers. [13] The U.S. wants McDonald's to seize control of the airwaves from the evil Taco Bell, but Russia is challenging that air time with their own marketers.

"Why do Canadians, or at least where i'm from, still measure height in feet and inches and weight in pounds if we use the metric system? [1] Okay, all of these answers are incorrect.

"How is the ketogenic diet at all healthy if you're eating lots of fats, which clog arteries? [1] Put in a very simple way: [2] Fat does not clog arteries by itself, fat deposits on blood vessel walls as a protective measure, against damaged caused to the lining by other things, mainly, sugar. [3] its a protective measure to prevent further damage to the vessels, and to the blood constituents, the issue is that damage accumulates and so does fat unless lifestyle is changed. [4] In the early 20th century when people saw clotted arteries with fat, calcium etc, they erroneously assumed that those dietary elements were the factor that was causing the issue, without realising that they were blaming the defensive measure for the problem. [5] Sadly medicine is this giant machine that takes ages to acknowledge information is inaccurate, and even longer to start changing how it deals with it, it takes decades. [6] And analogy: [7] They saw a huge traffic jam, they saw shinny lights (cops) and blamed the cops for the jam, instead of realising the cops are there because there was a car crash, which is the true factor to blame for the jam. [8] Ketogenic and vegetarian diets are good to help reduce and even reverse those issues, because you are removing the factors that cause damage to the inner lining of the blood vessels (excess sugar), also helps with diabetes as you prevent constant insulin spikes which lead to insensitivity. [9] Fats are needed by the body, and quite healthy in themselves, yes, even saturated which is quite important for you, the issue is also how much you eat.

"Money - If a bank takes a deposit and lends it out again have we got twice as much money as before? [1] Yes and no. [2] It depends really how you account for money.

"A classic argument is: the universe can't come from nothingness, because something can't come from nothingness; Stephen Hawking says yes it can; Brian Greene says current theory states that nothingness is actually a type potential; doesn't that make nothingness something after all? [1] So the problem here is that you're dancing around the semantic problem of defining ""nothingness"". [2] In physics, nothing is *nothing*: even empty space is a frothing sea of quantum foam with particles spontaneously popping in and out of existence constantly. [3] Inside the universe, there is no such thing as ""nothing"". [4] In that context, from what we think we might possibly know about ""before"" the universe, it's possible that our universe spontaneously sprang from ""nothing"" in the same way that particles out in empty space spring up from ""nothing"". [5] There might be a potential for universes to exist, and our universe is the result of that potential. [6] But that brings up another semantic point: what was ""before"" the universe? [7] Well, there is no ""before"", because time is a function of the universe. [8] You can't say ""before"" the universe because that requires a dimension of time that's moving in one direction. [9] Imagine a line starting at one point and going infinitely off in one direction. [10] What's on the line before it starts? [11] There *is no line* before the line starts. [12] We're using words and concepts that necessarily must exist within our universe and according to its rules to try to describe something that exists outside of those boundaries.

"How a nuclear reactor works to produce energy. [1] Nuclear reactors use fissionable materials (Usually Uranium or Plutonium) that emit “fast” neutrons naturally through radioactive decay. [2] These neutrons are usually moving too fast to actually be absorbed by the fuel normally, but they do travel into a moderator (usually water because it is stable and doubles as a coolant) that can slow them down by letting the neutrons bounce around a bit, transferring the energy to the moderator molecules in the form of heat. [3] When these neutrons have slowed enough, they are considered “thermalized” and they drift back into the fuel region and are able to be absorbed by the fissionable material which destabilizes it, causing fission which releases a lot more fast neutrons that go and do the same thing. [4] The heat generated by the neutron in the moderator is transferred to a coolant (if they aren't the same thing) and can either cause boiling in the core (such as with a boiling water reactor) or is transferred to a lower pressure system through a heat exchanger called a steam generator which causes boiling in this secondary system (in a Pressurized Water Reactor). [5] The high pressure steam is then sent through a turbine that spins to generate electricity. [6] Any leftover low pressure steam after the turbine has the excess heat transferred out into an outside source of water (coolant tower, lake, river, ocean, etc.) through another heat exchanger called a condenser. [7] The condensed water is then pumped back into the Reactor core or Steam Generator to repeat the process. [8] Each system is self-enclosed and the water never mixes. [9] The neutron creation in the core is controlled by using moveable control rods made out of a material that can absorb neutrons such as boron or by chemically adding the neutron absorber to the core in controlled amounts. [10] The amount of neutron absorber added or Control Rod movement will control exactly how many neutrons are absorbed, preventing them from going back into the core to create more fissions which directly control the heat generated by the reactor, thus the power generated. [11] tl;dr: Hot core creates steam which pushes a turbine around which generates power. [12] The heat level of the core is controlled by chemicals and/or rods.

"Whenever a wound recovers, like from surgery, how does the blood vessels around the area connect itself to their right counterparts on the other side of the wound? [1] There are a lot of people saying ""They don't"". [2] That is wrong. [3] They do. [4] In the healing process, a hormone known as VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is released, and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. [5] The details are complicated, but oftentimes instead of one vessel connecting itself on both sides, you have several to many smaller vessels forming from both sides, joining up with each other, and ultimately connecting the two sides. [6] Imagine a big pipe that gets split into smaller pipes that all eventually connect back to the big pipe on the other side. [7] That's the simple version. [8] The complicated version involves scar tissue, collagen production and breakdown, a host of hormones and humoral factors, but the bottom line is that vessels do, in fact, re-grow.

"What to people have to gain by claiming climate change isn't happening? [1] Two really key points that need to be straightened out first before answering you. [2] * [3] Very few influential people are claiming that climate change isn't happening, there's just too much evidence for it. [4] What a number of people are doing is claiming that climate change (in the form of regional effects of global warming) is not being caused by HUMAN activity. [5] If it's a natural process, we can't be to blame for it. [6] * [7] Different people have different motivations. [8] Some people honestly do believe that the ""truth"" is humans aren't causing it, either because their own research leads them to this conclusion or because they believe other people's messages and they're just conveying those opinions onward. [9] So let's talk about the people who originally create those messages that others might follow, and answer your question. [10] Many of those people sometimes have very strong interests in disconnecting human activity sources from climate change results. [11] They work for or represent companies that do things like produce lots of greenhouse gas, or produce and sell non-renewal energy sources like coal and gasoline. [12] So their livelihood depends on people not believing that they're causing a potential problem, and they do their best to try and suppress that belief. [13] Or they're argumentative as a job or as a hobby. [14] A lot of the conspiracy theorists out there don't believe any messages that come from government, and apply less-than-scientific processes to their cherry-picked analysis of what the causes are.

"What determines whether or not someone is a naturally good singer? [1] Physically speaking, being a naturally good singer means you were born with a good ""instrument"". [2] Your vocal cords would be more elastic and flexible, and this would make your voice able to produce more overtones, or the right mix of overtones which sound pleasant. [3] Overtones are basically sound waves on top of sound waves which have wavelengths that overlap on the original wave, e.g. half the wavelength, one third the wavelength, and we can tell the difference between a trumpet and a piano or a sweet and a shrill voice largely by picking up on the differences between the mixtures of overtones. [4] Besides that, being naturally coordinated would help controlling the muscles which keep a steady pitch or vibrato or volume, being naturally gifted in pitch and tone differentiation would be important(good ear, perfect pitch), and because IMO natural abilities get a little too much credit with the general public, a natural patience, memory, intelligence, passion and persistence would all be very important when it comes to learning and practicing.

"Why is it that a vast majority of attempted cyber attacks originate from China? [1] Long story short: there are numerous security companies in China whose work primarily consists of attempting to breach foreign companies' databases, some directly on behalf of the Chinese government, some just to sell the information to the highest bidder (oftentimes the Chinese government anyway). [2] As for the history that led to that point, my knowledge is a little shaky since it's been a while since I've seriously read literature on the subject, so take the following with a grain of salt. [3] Cyber attacks and information theft are official policy of the PRC, intended to strengthen the country. [4] As for why there are so many, that's because China simply has more hackers. [5] From the 1990s to around 2005, China had a large community of patriotic computer hackers who operated independently or in non-government-affiliated groups, yet with the tacit consent of the government (this had to do with their philosophy, which emphasized the role of the everyday citizen in the betterment of the country). [6] Around 2005, the Chinese government switched its stance and began cracking down on unsanctioned hacking. [7] Most of the hackers either quit causing trouble, or legitimized into security companies so that they could continue to operate with the approval of the Chinese government. [8] The government itself also operates several military units dedicated to hacking as well, but those are probably less relevant to you (assuming you don't work for a defense contractor or military R & D company). [9] Incidentally, do you know the time stamps for the attempted logins? [10] The security companies in China tend to operate on a 9-5 schedule, Beijing time. [11] EDIT:
If anyone's interested, here are some relevant readings: [12] * *The Dark Visitor - Scott Henderson* - Silly cover aside, it details the history of the Chinese hacking community and how it has evolved.

"Why do manufacturers make different types of screw heads? [1] The format (apart from the tool standard) follows function and/or aesthetics - conic flat heads for when they need to be flush with the surface for example. [2] Now, for the tool standard, they differ due to cost, application, evolution, competing standards, etc. [3] The old simple slotted head is cheap to make and good for hand turning, but when you use an electric tool, they make it dufficult to keep the driver centered, so you start needing something different. [4] The phillips type was developed with this in mind; it's self-centering, but they are also more prone to get damaged if the tool slips or a lot of torque is needed. [5] For this case, the allen is better (albeit not self centering, but good for automated robot assembly). [6] But hey, with excess torque it's also possible to damage the screw head - specially with the wrong size due to the metric/imperial mess of allen tools. [7] Let's come up with an evolution - torx. [8] No slipping, single size standard, more self-centering than allen (IMO, the best, we should only have torx). [9] But that's more expensive to make than the old single slot, I guess, and relatively ""new"". [10] Then there are the ones specifically made to avoid tinkering (require special, not easily available tools), and the opposite: ones made so you can use either a phillips or a standard slot screwdriver (I suppose for stuff designed to be self assembled by the average consumer who doesn't have dozens of screwdrivers).",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Auxiliary Information [8] Auxiliary Information [9] Auxiliary Information [10] Answer,4t9lgn,d5fm3mn,"[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Answer (Summary) [3] Answer,Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [4] Answer,Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [5] Answer,Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Answer,Auxiliary Information,Miscellaneous [8] Answer,Auxiliary Information [9] Answer,Auxiliary Information [10] Answer,Auxiliary Information"

"Why is a 1 degree temperature difference in climate such a big deal? [1] Ice, ice, baby.

"Why do dams have a massive ramp when releasing overflow water? [1] Spillways are generally used in emergency situations when you need to reduce the water level in your reservoir FAST. [2] The water released has huge amounts of energy, as you can see in the video. [3] Think of all the damage that water can do when it reaches the bottom. [4] If you just had a ramp straight down, the water would reach the downstream riverbed with huge amounts of energy, and start pushing away the soil and rocks at the bottom (causing erosion). [5] But, so what if that stuff gets pushed away? [6] Well the dam is a really heavy structure that's supporting lots of pressure, and so it requires a good base to stand on. [7] If this erosion goes uncontrolled, the dam can become unsupported and lose stability, leading to a collapse. [8] This would be catastrophic for anyone/anything that is downstream. [9] (You can google dam collapses, that shit ain't pretty). [10] With this in mind, spillways are designed with a big curve at the bottom called a 'ski jump'.

"from material science perspective if possible, why we let the food cool down to room temperature before putting it in the freezer or refrigerator. [1] In the olden days, we didn't have refrigerators or freezers. [2] We had insulated iceboxes. [3] The [ice man](_URL_0_) would bring by a chunk of ice every day (see also: milk man, egg man, and mail man). [4] The ice would be put in the top of icebox. [5] The ice would melt and run down the inside walls, cooling what was placed there, and the water would collect in a drip tray at the bottom. [6] If you put hot food in the icebox, it would melt the ice faster. [7] All the ice would melt before the ice man came again and your food would spoil. [8] So it was common practice to let the food cool to room temperature before putting it into the icebox. [9] Early refrigerator/freezers weren't very efficient, taking a long time to cool down hot food and allowing other food to get warmer in the process, so the practice continued.

"from material science perspective if possible, why we let the food cool down to room temperature before putting it in the freezer or refrigerator. [1] As others have said, the main reason this is done is to not to heat up the inside of your fridge, but honestly, 99% of the cooking people do at home is perfectly fine to straight to the fridge. [2] The only time you might have an issue is if say you trying to put a gallon of piping hot soup into a mini fridge, but a standard size modern refrigerator won't really be affected. [3] Having worked in kitchens for a long time, I can tell you the main reason we allow a soup or sauce to cool before transfer is mainly the potential danger involved in transporting 5 gallons of 200° liquid. [4] Since you are more than likely not dealing with this volume at home, it really shouldn't be an issue.

"Why are TV and Monitor manufacturers along with TV Cable subscription company's marketing 3840x2160 as 4K when in 4K's native resolution is 4096x2160? [1] 4K 4096x2160 is a digital cinema resolution, similar to 2k in aspect ratio which is 2048x1080. [2] The broadcast world uses aspect ratios of 16x9, e.g, 1920x1080, or 3840 x 2160. [3] In cinema, there are two overall aspect ratios depending what the content is, if your film is 1.78 - 2.0, people tend to use a flat container, meaning the image is scaled into a 1:1 pixel aspect ratio, introducing letterbox if the active image aspect ratio is greater than 1.89:1. [4] For titles with aspect ratios larger than 2, e.g 2.4 or 2.35 or 2.39 and more, they'll use the frame called scope, which has a pixel aspect ratio or 1.5:1. [5] Basically so they can squeeze more content into a frame, in this case preserving the vertical information more so than the horizontal. [6] When the image is projected, the image is unsqueezed, preserving more detail or image than would exist in a flat container. [7] Broadcast/ consumer electronics are more restricted, in order to broadcast over the air, the distribution architecture decided on 16x9. [8] Some televisions do support digital cinema initiative frames, many 4K capable televisions will squeeze 4096x2160 content into a 3840x2160 frame.

"How can a side affects of antidepressants be thoughts of suicide? [1] The side effect isn't as direct as your post title makes it seem. [2] Rather it goes like this: [3] A heavily depressed person has suicidal thoughts/tendencies, however the depression is so deep that it negates the will/drive to do anything, including committing suicide. [4] On starting the therapy, the therapist realizes that any treatment will fail due to the absolute lack of drive and deep seated melancholia. [5] He prescribes antidepressants. [6] They work as intended and increase the depressive persons activity level, thus making them theoretically ""fit"" for treatment. [7] However in doing so, the pharmaceuticals also increased the likelihood of suicide as the treated person now has enough drive/motivation to act, including potentially acting on their suicidal tendencies. [8] TL:DR [9] Sometimes the only thing keeping a depressed person from committing suicide, is their total lack of drive to act.

"What caused racial division and discrimination between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda?

"How are consumable meats cultured in labs? [1] Actually we all start out as a lump of cells when we were still an embryo. [2] When cells divide, you will grow in size and your cells will start to specialize in certain functions (for example skin cells can absorb sunlight). [3] Thus by absorbing enough nutrients, the lump of cells can divide and grow into a human. [4] Now if you want to grow meat, the process is more complex. [5] Main problem is that the cells will try to specialize into a task. [6] So you add drugs to stop the process. [7] Also your Petri dish will run out of nutrients as the cells kept dividing non-stop, thus it will be better if you use an entire tank of cell culture instead. [8] Just keep refilling the tank until the meat is ready. [9] Keep in mind though this is VERY expensive.

"How do airlines outside of the United States provide such a great experience at a lower cost than those in the U.S.? [1] There are a number of reasons. [2] First, labor is far cheaper in Asia than in the US. [3] The cost of labor is about the same as the cost for fuel for airlines in the US, at around 30% of total airline costs. [4] By contrast, it is usually around 15% for Asian airlines, with fuel being almost 40% of their costs. [5] Second, many Asian airlines are state owned or heavily subsidized by the state. [6] Those states recognize that bringing in people to spend money in their country benefits them. [7] By contrast, airlines in the US are (mostly) privately owned and only benefit by taking you from place to place. [8] Once you step off the plane, they don't get more money out of you until you get back on. [9] Third, the people who fly on Asian airlines tend to be upper class citizens. [10] A far smaller percentage of their population might fly somewhere, and those that do fly tend to be from the upper end of the classes. [11] By contrast, people from a larger variety of the socioeconomic spectrum fly in the US.

Why do artists wear an earpiece when performing a concert? [1] These are in ear monitors. [2] If they do not have them they usually have speakers on stage directed at them. [3] The problem with performing a music piece is that you do not hear how the music sounds when you are in the middle of it.

[5] So you might perform a guitar solo on one side of the stage and hit every beat as you hear the bass guitar on the other side of the stage and it sounds perfect to you. [6] However to the public it sounds like you are too slow and quiet because the sounds takes some time to go from the bass guitar across the stage to you. [7] So to make sure you hear the beat and the music as the public hear it you need to monitor the sound coming though the sound system.

"Why is it a ticketable offense to ride in a car without seatbelts on yet a motorcyclist that faces the same risks with less protection doesn't have to worry with such restraints?

"Why do lower-income folk work multiple jobs to support themselves rather than work more hours at a single job? [1] It may not be available to them. [2] Full-time positions are significantly more expensive for companies, as once you cross a certain threshold of hours the benefits you need to offer your employees increases. [3] (Exactly what depends on the state.) [4] Thus, a company may be able to save money by juggling several part-time people to meet their needs rather than employing one full time.

"Is vaping unhealthy? Ive read different articles, some that says it might be bad, and some that says its harmless. [1] The issue with vaping is that it is a relatively new way to use nicotine. [2] It took decades of research and observation to identify the adverse health effects to chronic users of other tobacco products, and it will likely take a similar amount of time to confidently identify any problems that arise with e-cigarette use. [3] That said, e-cigarettes do not contain the same harmful ingredients as cigarettes, which probably makes them safer, although I can't say how much. [4] There have been some studies that show using e-cigarettes increases your risk of developing respiratory symptoms such as coughing or increased phlegm production. [5] It is possible that it could increase your risk for heart disease, although that risk seems to be hypothetical at the moment. [6] As far as cancer goes, while many of the carcinogens found in cigarettes are much lower in e-cigarettes, propylene glycol and glycerol (the main components in the liquid cartridge) both break down into several potential carcinogens. [7] I can't say whether this makes lung cancer/disease more or less likely, however. [8] And of course, nicotine abuse is bad for your cardiovascular system. [9] That has not changed. [10] TLDR; it's up in the air. [11] The general consensus seems to be it is likely safer than cigarettes, however it's possible that there could be some bad stuff in the vapor.

"Why are polar bears and grizzly bears considered different species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring? [1] It's very difficult to group living, evolving organisms into discrete categories. [2] Polar bears diverged from the rest of the *Ursus* genus very recently, therefore they are still genetically similar enough to other bears to produce fertile offspring. [3] Taxonomy is also based on physical appearance. [4] Since polar bears are  quite distinct from other species of bears in terms of their physical appearance and geographical habitat, the decision was made to consider them a separate species. [5] Doves and pigeons are another example. [6] There are 310 species of birds within the *Columbiformes* order (which encompasses all pigeon and dove families), many of which are capable of breeding with other species and producing fertile offspring. [7] Their classification as separate species lies mainly in their physical differences. [8] The long and the short of it is that taxonomy is a human construct, and not everything fits nice and neatly between the lines all of the time. [9] **Tl;dr:** while this typically isn't the case, there is no hard, taxonomic rule stating that members of different species cannot produce fertile offspring.

"Why large store chains closing down? [1] Retail has always been a challenging business due to cash flow issues for maintaining inventory, selecting the correct inventory, etc. [2] Certainly eCommerce has hurt a great deal... both because people choose it out of convenience and also because it allows for easy price comparison shopping.

"How do “they” determine how many calories are in something? [1] The old-school way was to actually burn it and see how much heat it produced: a calorie is an actual measure of energy. [2] Nowadays, the food would be blended up and analyzed for the amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrate and alcohol (the stuff you can get energy/calories from), and knowing the amount of calories in each of those by weight, they just calculate how many calories it should have.

"Why do people get motion sick while being a passenger in a car, but don't get that same sickness if they were to be the driver of that car going to the same location? [1] If you're the driver you're in direct control of the sensations you're experiencing. [2] Its your input on the steering wheel or throttle pedal or whatever that's causing the things you're feeling now; being pulled to one side, or being pushed back in the seat, or being shifted forward into the seatbelt, whatever. [3] If you're a passenger, this stuff just happens to you, and some people can deal with that better than others. [4] Motion sickness is theorised to be caused by a disconnect between what you're feeling and what your eyes are seeing; your brain thinks there's something wrong, so makes you throw up to at least limit the possibility of poisoning. [5] Some are more sensitive to that disconnect than others and it can work in both ways. [6] I know people who can quite happily sit in the back of a car and read a book and I also used to know someone who played the original GTA, (yes [this one](_URL_0_)), and got motion sickness from that.

"Why do people get motion sick while being a passenger in a car, but don't get that same sickness if they were to be the driver of that car going to the same location? [1] Generally motion sickness (whether car, boat, or video game) is caused by a disagreement between your eyes and the semicircular canals in your ears. [2] In nature there's usually no reason for your eyes to see violent motion that is not being also perceived by your ears (or vice versa) so your body will decide that it is being poisoned (eg: the ""spins"" when you've borderline poisoned yourself with alcohol). [3] The body's only real remedy for poison is to purge so you get nauseous then, if that doesn't solve the problem by making you stop making yourself dizzy, throw up. [4] If you find yourself getting seasick or carsick watch the horizon like it's the most exciting thing ever. [5] Since the horizon is not moving, focusing all your attention on it will make your eyes and ears agree. [6] It also helps to look forward since we're used to looking forward so looking backward or sideways still has things (especially close things) tilting and moving the wrong way for what your balance expects. [7] With video games, you can move farther from the screen or use a smaller screen so that the stationary room provides a frame that anchors you visual perception of motion. [8] source: a sailor prone to seasickness and a gamer prone to gamesickness.

"I am living in a building where we are several students with one room each and we share a kitchen.

"Why Google Chrome tabs can consume up to 100-150 megabytes of memory while many of them consist just of kilobytes of javascript? [1] I am not a chrome expert, but there are a number of possible reasons: [2] The biggest offender is probably the chrome sandbox. [3] To limit the damage should someone figure out how to hack the browser, each ""tab"" is walled off from the others by running each in a separate process. [4] Part of the increased security comes from the processes having separate memory. [5] The downside is that each tab is essentially a full copy of the application, and that results in a lot of redundant memory usage. [6] Another is likely to be memory management strategy. [7] It takes computing power to go off and free the ram when you're done using it. [8] In a language like javascript this typically means halting execution and looking for objects which are no longer needed. [9] What this means is that it makes more sense to wait until you're out of memory before you go off trying to free some up. [10] I know there are (at least used to be) places in the code where the javascript engine would intentionally leak memory on shutdown because it's faster for the OS to dismiss it (on exit) then to go through a full shutdown.
