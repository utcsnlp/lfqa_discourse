"What does it mean when music is written in a certain key? [1] Think of the key as a starting point for a typical scale used in a piece of music. [2] Each song will have the same basic scale in order for it to sound pleasing to the ear or, in the right key. [3] Your basic key for music is the key of C, which employs the notes C through G and back to B again, naturally with no ""sharps"" or ""flats."" [4] These scales can be offset starting with a different note other than C. After this is done, the pattern of sound differences must be carried over to the new notes by using sharps and flats. [5] Using the C major and G major keys as an example, the C scale would read C,D,E,F,G,A,B, with a smaller pitch gap between E-F and B-C, called a half-step. [6] These small gaps will change based on whether the key is major or minor. [7] With a G major scale, you start on G and implement the half-steps into the same places they would be in the C scale. [8] With Gmaj we see G,A,B,C,D,E,F#(sharp), keeping the half-steps where they should be (B-C, F#-G)",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer - Example,130rg9,c6zspu1,"[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Answer (Summary),Auxiliary Information [3] Answer,Auxiliary Information [4] Answer,Auxiliary Information [5] Answer,Answer - Example [6] Answer,Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [7] Answer,Answer - Example [8] Answer,Answer - Example"

"Why are the ceilings in so many grocery stores so high? [1] The greatest benefit to height is in the event of a fire. [2] Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor (e.g., people, fire load/combustibles). [3] The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components, such as sprinkler heads. [4] In addition, it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes (exchanges per hour) that are not as noticeable in one spot. [5] (Except for those annoying freeze-or-fry areas where air flows are concentrated.) [6] The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building, either by exhaust or pressurizing the building (negative and positive pressure ventilation, respectively). [7] Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer (higher) columns required, which in turn need to be stronger because of (typically) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses. [8] Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required. [9] When designers are tasked to create 'open space', regardless of low or high ceilings, larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased, thus 'opening' the space. [10] However, this is not always the case, such as in multi-story structures where significant weight/loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing (e.g., airports, parking ramps, hotels). [11] Operating costs do tend to be higher, but it is a trade off on the desired space/affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense. [12] Such factors are taken into consideration during the design phase of projects, so the owner/operator knows early-on what to expect. [13] These factors also contribute to changes in a design if costs are deemed to be unreasonable or exceeding targets/goals. [14] Source: Engineer by day, Firefighter by night.

/u/thef1guy [2] The U.S strategy is what military planners call 'funnelling'. [3] The objective wasn't to destroy ISIL(S) command  &  control centers, but funnel their attacking routes towards the Assad troops. [4] When CIA backed rebels are cornered by ISIL advancements, the coalition will launch defensive strikes to deter them from an advancement, thereby pushing them towards Assad forces instead.

[6] If the U.S really wanted to destroy the core of ISIL(S), they would have done so already.

"What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm. [1] MD here. [2] Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). [3] For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. [4] A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. [5] The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. [6] However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (""extravasate""). [7] These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. [8] The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. [9] When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the ""high"" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. [10] Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting ""rush"" that IV heroin users are chasing. [11] If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high.

"Why has Walmart struggled overseas when it was able to completely dominate the United States market? [1] I live in Germany, where Walmart spectacularly failed. [2] The biggest issue seems to be that Walmart failed to understand how cultural differences come into play; among the problems that are blamed for Walmart's failure in Germany are: [3] * overambitious expansionist plans that went ahead despite the fact that a German company had successfully fought off a hostile takeover bid, at a time when Walmart was still very small in Germany;
* attempts to cut costs by threatening workers with redundancy if they didn't accept working practices that were borderline illegal in Germany;
* being forced by a German court to comply with German law by publishing financial statements, which revealed that the company was far worse off than it had claimed;
* annoying employees and customers alike by insisting on policies that work well in the US but which Germans find creepy, such as employing greeters, or making staff offer assistance to any customer that comes within range (Germans prefer to be left to shop on their own, and to approach staff if and when they need help).

"Why do websites make you have a complicated password when most account breaches come from a hack and not just guessing? [1] When people hack sites for passwords, they usually get a list of the hashed passwords. [2] That means when you put in your password, the site can check if it's the same password you signed up with but it doesn't know what the password is. [3] It's like a one-way secret message. [4] The way hackers figure out passwords is they know common hashing techniques and they guess common passwords using those techniques. [5] Since ""password123"" is a common password, they'll put that in the hash, see what comes out, and match that output to the stolen list of hashed passwords they got. [6] If they can't guess your password to input, then they won't be able to know what it is. [7] Complex passwords make it harder to guess the hashed passwords once they're stolen. [8] The biggest factors for making a password hard to guess are the total numbers of characters you can use and the length. [9] So forcing you to have three special characters and two capitals and a number doesn't really help, but allowing you to use any character and requiring your password to be long does help. [10] In other words, ""a%6L7"" looks like a more securepassword than""!X [11] XthisismypasswordforthissiteX!"", but the latter is actually more secure since it's longer and can possibly use just as many symbols.

"Why are people against mandatory background checks before buying a gun? [1] In the US, there's already a [mandatory background check](_URL_0_) to buy a gun in a retail setting (if you buy a new or used gun from a store, you will have a background check). [2] Further, because the federal government can regulate sales of things that cross state lines, it's illegal for two people to sell a gun privately without involving a retail store (and thus a background check) if they don't reside in the same state. [3] There isn't a background check on private sales within most states. [4] So when someone says, we want mandatory background checks on all gun sales, they mean they want them on private, in state gun sales. [5] The opposition points out that we enforce the background checks on retail sales by [very strictly controlling the inventory of retailers](_URL_1_) (they must keep a log book of every single gun that goes through their store). [6] Gun owners are exceedingly concerned that a similar registration of the guns they own gives the state a tool that's much too useful should it ever wish to seize the guns (since it would know where every single gun in the nation is).

". How can I sit in a ~200° F sauna and not get burned, but water the same temperature spilled on my arm will burn and blister my skin? [1] Both correct answers are here already but neither in the same post with one another. [2] First, water has high heat capacity. [3] That means that even a small change in temperature for water = a ton of energy. [4] So 200 degree water has thousands of times more heat than air for every degree of temperature change, and that's based on MASS. [5] The density of water is much higher than that of air so there's a lot more of it close to you when you're exposed to it. [6] Finally, because of the density, it transfers energy much much faster. [7] Heat is transferred when molecules hit one another - more density means more molecules close together, which means more collisions = faster energy transfer. [8] For an example of this at work try to bake a potato in a 450 deg F oven while boiling one in 212 deg F (boiling) water. [9] Should go alot faster in the water.

[3] Li-ion only commercialized in the 90s and even now li-ion has a rather low energy density compared to fuel. [4] Batteries (and supercapacitors) are very tricky, a lot that works in the lab doesn't work outside. [5] It also took us a very long time before we knew what to do with semi-conductors, sometimes it takes just takes a long time to improve something enough to make it viable. [6] People are too quick to blame it all on ""corporate greed"". [7] Edit: [8] There's also the problem that batteries lose capacity from discharging, which has improved a lot over 100 years.( [9] (cycle durability has increased) [10] Charge/discharge efficiency has also improved a lot over the last 100 years.",[1] Answer [2] Answer - Example [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Miscellaneous [7] Miscellaneous [8] Answer [9] Answer [10] Answer,853iir,dvugo9n,"[1] Answer,Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Answer - Example [3] Answer [4] Answer,Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer,Auxiliary Information,Miscellaneous [7] Miscellaneous [8] Answer [9] Answer,Auxiliary Information [10] Answer,Answer (Summary)"
"What are the benefits of marriage in the U.S.? [1] I think one of the biggest ones is that your spouse becomes your legal 'next of kin', meaning you can make medical decisions for them, own their property after they die, etc. [2] If you aren't married you are not legally a part of that person's life, so any legal or medical decisions would be up to the parents of that individual. [3] That's why marriage equality was important a few years ago. [4] If someone was with their partner for 15 years and then suddenly dropped dead, their partner had better hope their in-laws liked them or even supported the partnership in the first place. [5] If not, the parents could just take the house and all the money (provided the person didn't have a will). [6] There are probably other benefits, but I think this is one of the big ones.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer,86kera,dw5om2r,"[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [5] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [6] Answer,Miscellaneous"
"If a star is 5 million light years away, then are we looking into the past? [1] You are ""looking into the past"" whenever you look at *anything*. [2] Sure, that star is 5 million light years away, so what you're seeing is as it was 5 million years ago. [3] The sun is ~8 light minutes away. [4] You're seeing it as it was 8 minutes ago. [5] The moon? [6] ~2 seconds. [7] Your monitor? [8] A very tiny amount, but more than zero. [9] Edit: [10] As an addendum: the stars you generally see in the sky are not as far as 5M light years. [11] Our galaxy is only about 100 000 light years in diameter.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer - Example [9] Miscellaneous [10] Auxiliary Information [11] Auxiliary Information,l37v8,c2pfbhg,"[1] Answer,Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary),Answer - Example [3] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [5] Answer - Example,Answer - Organizational sentence,Auxiliary Information [6] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [7] Answer - Example,Answer - Organizational sentence,Auxiliary Information [8] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [9] Auxiliary Information,Miscellaneous [10] Auxiliary Information [11] Auxiliary Information"
"How does the silencer on a gun work? [1] A gun is loud for two reasons. [2] 1: any gun which fires a bullet which breaks the sound barrier is impossible to suppress without slowing the bullet. [3] Part of the sound is the sonic boom created by the bullet breaking the sound barrier. [4] 2: The way that a gun fires is to create enough pressure behind the bullet the push it out the barrel of the gun. [5] There are very hot gasses which expand very quickly. [6] A suppressor (also known as a silencer) slows the expansion of the gas outside of the barrel. [7] If you were to disassemble a suppressor, you would see it is basically a tube with small holes that feed into another chamber. [8] By giving the gasses a slightly larger area to expand in, it allows the gas to expand and cool at a slower rate.",[1] Answer - Organizational sentence [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Answer [8] Answer,lf6r4,c2s6f5i,"[1] Answer - Organizational sentence,Auxiliary Information [2] Answer,Answer - Organizational sentence,Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Organizational sentence,Auxiliary Information [5] Answer,Auxiliary Information [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Answer,Answer (Summary),Auxiliary Information [8] Answer,Answer (Summary)"
"File names. Why can't Microsoft Office save or open files that have slashes or colons in their names? [1] In addition and like others have said, file names are limitations of the file system. [2] The file system is like the drawer that holds the files. [3] The drawer has sections and each section can only fit a certain kind of file. [4] A legal sized file won't fit in a drawer that holds letter sized documents. [5] As a holdover from the days of the beginnings of Windows, many filename characters are not permitted such as  <  > ?!: etc., that is because the file system is not equipped to handle those types. [6] Using Microsoft Office on a Mac, you could save all kinds of filenames, save for those with a colon. [7] This is because Classic Mac OS uses colons to separate files. [8] The newer Mac OS uses colons at the basic system level, so it is reserved.

"When you're swimming, why doesn't the water flood your ears and kill you? [1] Lucky for you, your ear has a protective barrier called your tympanic membrane (eardrum). [2] This keeps the middle and inner ear separated from the outside environment. [3] Even if your eardrum gets torn, your body has a connection from the ear to the throat known as your Eustachian tube so if you were to go swimming with a perforated eardrum (a bad idea since the risk for infection skyrockets), you'd still be alright.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer,vcll8,c53apjt,"[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Answer (Summary) [3] Answer,Auxiliary Information"
