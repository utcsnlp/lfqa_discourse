"why is the cockerel the symbol of france [1] Its association with France dates back from the Middle Age and is due to the play on words in Latin between Gallus , meaning an inhabitant of Gaul , and gallus , meaning rooster , or cockerel . [2] Its use , by the enemies of France , dates to this period , originally a pun to make fun of the French , the association between the rooster and the Gauls / French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents : prior to being arrested , Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning . [3] At the rooster 's crowing , Peter remembered Jesus 's words . [4] Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil . [5] It is also an emblem of the Christian 's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ , the resurrection of the dead , and the final judgment of humankind .

"why is ireland not a member of the commonwealth [1] On 18 April 1949 , Ireland formally became a republic in accordance with the Irish Republic of Ireland Act 1948 . [2] Because it did this , it was automatically excluded from the Commonwealth .

[4] The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers ' meeting in London . [5] Under the London Declaration , India agreed that , when it became a republic in January 1950 , it would accept the British Sovereign as a `` symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth '' . [6] Upon hearing this , King George VI told the Indian politician Krishna Menon : `` [7] So , I 've become ' as such ' '' . [8] The other Commonwealth countries recognised India 's continuing membership of the association .

[10] Ireland had withdrawn its participation in the Commonwealth in the 1930s , attending its last Commonwealth governmental heads ' meeting in 1932 . [11] However it continued to be regarded by the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth member until it declared itself a republic , on 18 April 1949 .

"how did english government change during the glorious revolution [1] The Glorious Revolution of 1688 is considered by some as being one of the most important events in the long evolution of the respective powers of Parliament and the Crown in England . [2] With the passage of the Bill of Rights , it stamped out once and for all any possibility of a Catholic monarchy , and ended moves towards absolute monarchy in the British kingdoms by circumscribing the monarch 's powers . [3] These powers were greatly restricted ; he or she could no longer suspend laws , levy taxes , make royal appointments , or maintain a standing army during peacetime without Parliament 's permission -- to this day the Army is known as the `` British Army '' not the `` Royal Army '' as it is , in some sense , Parliament 's Army and not that of the King . ( This is , however , a complex issue , as the Crown remains the source of all executive authority in the British army , with legal implications for unlawful orders etc . ) . [4] Since 1689 , government under a system of constitutional monarchy in England , and later the United Kingdom , has been uninterrupted . [5] Since then , Parliament 's power has steadily increased while the Crown 's has steadily declined . [6] Unlike in the English civil war of the mid-seventeenth century , the `` Glorious Revolution '' did not involve the masses of ordinary people in England ( the majority of the bloodshed occurred in Ireland ) . [7] This fact has led many historians , including Stephen Webb , to suggest that , in England at least , the events more closely resemble a coup d'état than a social revolution .

"how did the new deal create a new meaning for liberalism [1] The realignment crystallized into the New Deal Coalition that dominated most presidential elections into the 1960s , while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress from 1939 - 64 . [2] By 1936 the term `` liberal '' typically was used for supporters of the New Deal , and `` conservative '' for its opponents . [3] From 1934 to 1938 , Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavors by a `` pro-spender '' majority in Congress ( drawn from two - party , competitive , non-machine , Progressive , and Left party districts ) . [4] In the 1938 midterm election , Roosevelt and his liberal supporters lost control of Congress to the bipartisan conservative coalition . [5] Historians generally agree that during Roosevelt 's 12 years in office , there was a dramatic increase in the power of the federal government as a whole . [6] Roosevelt also established the presidency as the prominent center of authority within the federal government . [7] Roosevelt created a large array of agencies protecting various groups of citizens -- workers , farmers , and others -- who suffered from the crisis , and thus enabled them to challenge the powers of the corporations . [8] In this way , the Roosevelt Administration generated a set of political ideas -- known as New Deal liberalism -- that remained a source of inspiration and controversy for decades . [9] New Deal liberalism lay the foundation of a new consensus . [10] Between 1940 and 1980 there was the liberal consensus about the prospects for the widespread distribution of prosperity within an expanding capitalist economy . [11] Especially Harry S. Truman 's Fair Deal and in the 1960s , Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs .",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Answer (Summary) [8] Answer (Summary) [9] Answer [10] Answer - Example [11] Auxiliary Information

"what is the main difference between lymph and interstitial fluid [1] Lymph is the fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system . [2] The lymph is formed when the interstitial fluid ( the fluid which lies in the interstices of all body tissues ) is collected through lymph capillaries . [3] It is then transported through larger lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes , where it is cleaned by lymphocytes , before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein , where it mixes back with the blood . [4] Since the lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid , its composition continually changes as the blood and the surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid . [5] It is generally similar to blood plasma , which is the fluid component of blood . [6] Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream . [7] Lymph may pick up bacteria and bring them to lymph nodes , where they are destroyed . [8] Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph . [9] Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system ( beginning in the lacteals ) to the blood via chylomicrons . [10] Interstitial fluid forms at the arterial ( coming from the heart ) end of capillaries because of the higher pressure of blood compared to veins , and most of it returns to its venous ends and venules ; the rest ( up to 10 % ) enters the lymph capillaries as lymph . [11] Thus , lymph when formed is a watery clear liquid with the same composition as the interstitial fluid . [12] However , as it flows through the lymph nodes it comes in contact with blood , and tends to accumulate more cells ( particularly , lymphocytes ) and proteins .",[1] Answer [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Auxiliary Information [8] Auxiliary Information [9] Auxiliary Information [10] Answer [11] Answer (Summary) [12] Answer (Summary)

"how do you determine what the root of the triad is [1] Although the safest way to recognize a chord 's root is , after having reduced the chord to close spacing , to rearrange it as a stack of thirds , there are shortcuts to this : in inverted triads , the root is directly above the interval of a fourth , in inverted sevenths , it is directly above the interval of a second . [2] With chord types , such as chords with added sixths or chords over pedal points , more than one possible chordal analysis may be possible . [3] For example , in a tonal piece of music , the notes C , E , G , A , sounded as a chord , could be analyzed as a C major sixth chord in root position ( a major triad -- C , E , G -- with an added sixth -- [4] A -- above the root ) or as a first inversion A minor seventh chord ( the A minor seventh chord contains the notes A , C , E and G , but in this example , the C note , the third of the A minor chord , is in the bass ) . [5] Deciding which note is the root of this chord could be determined by considering context . [6] If the chord spelled C , E , G , A occurs immediately before a D chord ( spelled D , F ♯ , A , C ) , most theorists and musicians would consider the first chord a minor seventh chord in first inversion , because the progression ii -- [7] V is a standard chord movement .",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example

"how does a cladogram show the relationship among organisms [1] A cladogram ( from Greek clados `` branch '' and gramma `` character '' ) is a diagram used in cladistics to show relations among organisms . [2] A cladogram is not , however , an evolutionary tree because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants , nor does it show how much they have changed ; many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram . [3] A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a clade , a groups of organisms with a last common ancestor . [4] There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that branch off from other lines . [5] The lines can be traced back to where they branch off . [6] These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor ( not an actual entity ) which can be inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it . [7] This hypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about the order of evolution of various features , adaptation , and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors .

[4] ( ... ) On one hand every son who is not the eldest and hence not heir to the lineage territory has the potential of becoming a progenitor and fostering a new trunk lineage ( Ideally he would strike out to cultivate new lineage territory ) . [5] ( ... ) According to the Zou commentary , the son of heaven divided land among his feudal lords , his feudal lords divided land among their dependent families and so forth down the pecking order to the officers who had their dependent kin and the commoners who `` each had his apportioned relations and all had their graded precedence '' ''",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer [5] Answer (Summary)

"how do the british elect a prime minister [1] The office is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long - established convention , which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons ; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber . [2] The position of Prime Minister was not created ; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament , political developments , and accidents of history . [3] The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective . [4] The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement ( 1688 -- 1720 ) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament .

"what is the difference between alpha and beta glycosidic linkages [1] One distinguishes between α - and β - glycosidic bonds based on the relative stereochemistry ( R or S ) of the anomeric position and the stereocenter furthest from C1 in the saccharide . [2] An α - glycosidic bond is formed when both carbons have the same stereochemistry , whereas a β - glycosidic bond occurs when the two carbons have different stereochemistry . [3] One complicating issue is that the alpha and beta conformations were originally defined based on the relative orientation of the major constituents in a Haworth projection . [4] In this case , for D - sugars , a beta conformation would see the major constituent at each carbon drawn above the plane of the ring ( nominally the same conformation ) , while alpha would see the anomeric constituent below the ring ( nominally opposite conformations ) .

"how does a star become a main sequence [1] After condensation of mass and ignition of a star , it generates thermal energy in the dense core region through nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium . [2] During this stage of the star 's lifetime , it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass , but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors . [3] All main - sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium , where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers . [4] The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance .

[2] This frequency range is divided into separate bands , and the electromagnetic waves within each frequency band are called by different names ; beginning at the low frequency ( long wavelength ) end of the spectrum these are : radio waves , microwaves , infrared , visible light , ultraviolet , X-rays , and gamma rays at the high - frequency ( short wavelength ) end . [3] The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics , such as how they are produced , how they interact with matter , and their practical applications . [4] The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself , while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length .

"why are my eyes always red in photos [1] In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . [2] The camera records this reflected light . [3] The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . [4] The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . [5] The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . [6] The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . [7] Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . [8] But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . [9] The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . [10] This amount varies strongly between individuals . [11] Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . [12] The same holds for animals . [13] The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . [14] This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils . [15] Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because , in the dark , the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment .",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Auxiliary Information [8] Answer [9] Answer [10] Answer [11] Answer - Example [12] Auxiliary Information [13] Auxiliary Information [14] Auxiliary Information [15] Answer

[6] In case of call by value , what is passed to the function is the value of the argument -- for example , f ( 2 ) and a = 2 ; f ( a ) are equivalent calls -- while in call by reference , with a variable as argument , what is passed is a reference to that variable - even though the syntax for the function call could stay the same . [7] The specification for pass - by - reference or pass - by - value would be made in the function declaration and / or definition .",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer
"difference between single layer perceptron and multilayer perceptron [1] The term `` multilayer perceptron '' does not refer to a single perceptron that has multiple layers . [2] Rather , it contains many perceptrons that are organized into layers . [3] An alternative is `` multilayer perceptron network '' . [4] Moreover , MLP `` perceptrons '' are not perceptrons in the strictest possible sense . [5] True perceptrons are formally a special case of artificial neurons that use a threshold activation function such as the Heaviside step function . [6] MLP perceptrons can employ arbitrary activation functions . [7] A true perceptron performs binary classification ( either this or that ) , an MLP neuron is free to either perform classification or regression , depending upon its activation function .",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer [5] Answer [6] Answer [7] Answer (Summary)

"what is the rule for when easter is [1] For most of their history Christians have calculated Easter independently of the Jewish calendar . [2] In principle , Easter falls on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the northern spring equinox ( the paschal full moon ) . [3] However , the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation . [4] The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March ( previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox ) . [5] The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar , which again varied in different areas . [6] While Easter now falls at the earliest on the 15th of the lunar month and at the latest on the 21st , in some areas it used to fall at the earliest on the 14th ( the day of the paschal full moon ) and at the latest on the 20th , or between the sixteenth and the 22nd . [7] The last limit arises from the fact that the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th ( the eve of the Passover ) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth . [8] The `` computus '' is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March , and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year . [9] The synodic month had already been measured to a high degree of accuracy . [10] The schematic model that eventually was accepted is the Metonic cycle , which equates 19 tropical years to 235 synodic months .",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Auxiliary Information [8] Auxiliary Information [9] Auxiliary Information [10] Auxiliary Information
"how to write time and date in military [1] The United States military normally uses the `` dd mmm yyyy '' format for correspondence . [2] The common month - day - year format is used when corresponding with civilians . [3] The military date notation is similar to the date notation in British English but is read cardinally ( e.g. `` Nineteen July '' ) rather than ordinally ( e.g. `` [4] The nineteenth of July '' ) . [5] It is best known for its use by the military , and therefore commonly called `` military time '' . [6] In U.S. military use , 24 - hour time is traditionally written without a colon ( 1800 instead of 18 : 00 ) and in spoken language in the Army , but not the Navy , is followed by the word `` hours '' ( e.g. , `` eighteen hundred hours '' ) .",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Answer (Summary)
"what is meant by obstructing the field in cricket [1] Obstructing the field is one of the nine methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket . [2] It dictates that either batsman can be given out if he wilfully attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action . [3] It is governed by Law 37 of the laws of cricket , and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed : in the history of cricket , there have been only one instance in Test matches , six occasions in One Day International ( ODI ) games , and only one instance in Twenty20 International matches . [4] However , there have also been seven instances in Test cricket , and two in ODIs , where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball , a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field . [5] In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks that he is going to be run out and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball . [6] The obstruction has to be deliberate , so a batsman will not be out if the contact with the ball is inadvertent .",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer [6] Answer
"what is the difference between rayleigh and love waves [1] In elastodynamics , Love waves , named after Augustus Edward Hough Love , are horizontally polarized surface waves . [2] The Love wave is a result of the interference of many shear waves ( S -- waves ) guided by an elastic layer , which is welded to an elastic half space on one side while bordering a vacuum on the other side . [3] In seismology , Love waves ( also known as Q waves ( Quer : German for lateral ) ) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake . [4] Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911 . [5] They form a distinct class , different from other types of seismic waves , such as P - waves and S - waves ( both body waves ) , or Rayleigh waves ( another type of surface wave ) . [6] Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P - or S - waves , but faster than Rayleigh waves . [7] These waves are observed only when there is a low velocity layer overlying a high velocity layer / sub -- layers .",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Auxiliary Information

"what is peak and trough in relation to antibiotic therapy [1] In medicine and pharmacology , a trough level or trough concentration is the lowest concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered , often used in therapeutic drug monitoring . [2] The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time , the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region , before a new dose sends it higher again . [3] The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum , although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant . [4] It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour , the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body , so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping . [5] In a medicine that is administered periodically , the trough level should be measured just before the administration of the next dose in order to avoid overdosing . [6] A trough level is contrasted with a `` peak level '' , which is the highest level of the medicine in the body , and the `` average level '' , which is the mean level over time . [7] It helps in therapeutic drug monitoring . [8] It is widely used in clinical trials for newer medicines for its therapeutic effectiveness and safety .",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Answer [8] Auxiliary Information

"what the difference between high commissioner and ambassador [1] As sixteen Commonwealth members , known as the Commonwealth realms , share the same monarch as head of state ( currently Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II ) , diplomatic relations between these countries are traditionally at a governmental level . [2] In diplomatic usage , a high commissioner is considered equivalent in rank and role to an ambassador . [3] A high commissioner from one Commonwealth realm to another carries a simple and often informal letter of introduction from one head of government ( prime minister ) to that of another , host country , while ambassadors carry formal letters of credence from their head of state addressed to the host country 's head of state . [4] The difference in accreditation is also reflected in the formal titles of envoys to Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth states : e.g. , British high commissioners to the Commonwealth countries are formally titled `` The High Commissioner for Her Majesty 's Government in the United Kingdom '' , whereas British ambassadors to non-Commonwealth countries are known as `` Her Britannic Majesty 's Ambassador '' .
