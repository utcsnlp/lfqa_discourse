"If a nuclear bomb were being tested, and it didn't go off... how is it approached and dismantled? [0] A nuclear bomb is typically set off by a conventional bomb. [1] If the conventional bomb portion failed to fire, they would defuse it just like any other bomb. [2] If the nuclear portion failed to go off, the conventional bomb portion would have scattered the radioactive material all over, so they would have to go recover that material before it poisoned anyone nearby. [3] During the development of nuclear weapons at [White Sands Missile Range](_URL_0_) in New Mexico, they actually built a gigantic container, called [Jumbo](_URL_1_), to catch the nuclear material should the bomb fail to detonate correctly. [4] They were confident that the conventional part would fire, because at that point we had plenty of experience with ""normal"" bombs and didn't doubt it would fire. [5] They were worried that the nuclear portion wouldn't detonate. [6] In the end, though, they didn't use Jumbo, because by the time they were ready to fire they were confident that the nuclear portion would detonate. [7] >  Fears of a fizzle led to the construction of a steel containment vessel called Jumbo that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered, but Jumbo was not used.",[0] Answer [1] Answer [2] Answer [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Answer [6] Answer [7] Answer
"Why Does The Gender Wage Gap Exist? [0] It doesn't. [1] At least not in the way most people think. [2] Men on average earn more because men, on average, work longer hours at jobs that are more dangerous. [3] Something like 98% of work place deaths are men. [4] The idea that women get paid less in general for the same work with the same qualifications is BS. [5] The study that Wage Gapers point to to support their claims does not account or time actually worked or variance in careers.",[0] Answer [1] Answer [2] Answer [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Answer
"What is Third Way philosophy? [0] It's a mix of capitalism with big-government social programs, basically a version of Liberal Democracy. [1] The idea is that while communism and pure socialism don't work, neither does pure ""every man for himself"" capitalism. [2] Alongside free market we can have social services that provide people with job training, security, and other benefits.",[0] Answer [1] Answer [2] Answer
