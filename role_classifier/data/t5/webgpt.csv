"Why do people try to strive for maintaining eye contact while communicating? [1] Keeping eye contact with the person you are talking to shows that you are actively listening and paying attention. [2] To maintain appropriate eye contact without staring, you should maintain eye contact for 50% of the time while speaking and 70% of the time while listening. [3] This helps to display interest and confidence. [4] Once you establish eye contact, maintain it for 4-5 seconds. [5] After this time passes, you can slowly glance to the side and then go back to establishing eye contact.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information
"when to use Latino, Hispanic, and Mexican/Cuban/Puerto Rican/etc. [1] The United States government adopted the term Latino officially in 1997 to complement the English word “Hispanic,” which until then had been used to classify people living in the United States who were Spanish speakers, or belonged to a household where Spanish was spoken, or who were somehow of Spanish heritage, or who self-identified with Spanish ancestry or descent. [2] The word Latino also serves to categorize those people who come from Latin America, or descend from people from Latin America, where the spoken language is Spanish, but who are not happy with a noun such as “Hispanic,” which is too redolent of Spain, a country to which many of those formerly categorized as “Hispanics” do not want to be connected. [3] This is the case, for example, of some residents of Mexican descent in the United States, who do not want to be called “Hispanics,” but “Latinos.” [4] The term ""Mexican"" may refer to natives or inhabitants of Mexico or someone of Mexican descent. [5] The term ""Cuban"" may refer to natives or inhabitants of Cuba, or a someone of Cuban descent.

"How do firewalls work? [1] Firewalls work by filtering the data you receive over the internet so that only approved data reaches your computer. [2] Data is sent over the internet in two types of packets: TCP packets, which have information about their data content in their headers that make them easier for a firewall to filter, and UDP packets, which have port information but no header information to assist the filter. [3] The firewall inspects the packets and compares the content to the computer's data rule configuration so it only lets through what is approved. [4] The three kinds of firewalls are stateless (or packet filtering) firewalls, stateful firewalls, and application firewalls. [5] Stateless firewalls only inspect individual packet headers for approval or rejection, while stateful firewalls collect a group of packets, determine the group's connection state, and accepts or rejects the entire group based on a common header. [6] Application firewalls operate like stateful firewalls, but they inspect the data contained in the packets in addition to header information.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Answer [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information

"If I were to create a company, have $1M debt, go bankrupt, how would the company that I owe get its money ? do I have to pay ? [1] The debt you owe as a debtor to a company that goes into bankruptcy administration will become part of the assets of the company in bankruptcy. [2] If you cosigned on a business loan, you are equally as responsible as the corporation or LLC to pay it back. [3] Likewise, if you personally guarantee an obligation of the corporation or LLC then the creditor can come after your personal assets if the business defaults on the loan. [4] If you had a new company, a creditor may have required you to provide some sort of collateral before approving the loan. [5] If you agreed to pledge your house or other personal assets as collateral for the business loan, the creditor may be able to take your property and sell it to satisfy the obligations of the company. [6] A creditor can also try to go after your personal assets by eliminating the limited liability protection provided by the corporation or LLC. [7] This is commonly referred to as piercing the corporate veil. [8] This is more likely if corporate formalities were not followed, certain owners exerted too much control over the corporation or LLC, owners commingled personal funds with company funds, or if the company was not sufficiently capitalized when it was formed.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Auxiliary Information [8] Auxiliary Information

[2] The three main positions are guard, forward, and center, with the standard team featuring two guards, two forwards, and a center. [3] Over time, as more specialized roles developed, each of the guards and forwards came to be differentiated, and today each of the five positions are known by unique names, each of which has also been assigned a number: point guard (PG) or 1, the shooting guard (SG) or 2, the small forward (SF) or 3, the power forward (PF) or 4, and the center (C) or 5.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer (Summary)
"How much money is needed in order to not have to work for the rest of your life? [1] To determine how much money you need to never have to work again for the rest of your life, some calculation is needed to arrive at a dollar number tailored to you. [2] You need to consider the amount you spend yearly, the effect of inflation on your savings, and the income you need from an investment portfolio to keep ahead of inflation. [3] A reliable savings range is your current yearly spending multiplied by 28 to 36, with more security and comfort the higher the number is. [4] For example, if you spend $30,000 per year, savings of $1,000,000 is likely a good number. [5] However, another method of calculating is based on the median household income in the United States.

"Why is eating burnt food bad for you? [1] When certain foods are cooked at high temperatures, sugars, such as glucose and fructose, can react with the free amino acid, asparagine, to form acrylamide. [2] Acrylamide caused cancer in animals in studies where animals were exposed to acrylamide at very high doses. [3] In 2010, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) concluded that acrylamide is a human health concern and suggested additional long-term studies. [4] When it comes to cooking meat, there are two different chemicals that occur when meat is cooked. [5] Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are formed when fat and juices drip onto flames while frying, baking, or grilling meat. [6] Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) form when meat is exposed to high temperatures for a prolonged period; the longer the exposure, the more HCAs are formed. [7] Seventeen different HCAs resulting from the cooking of muscle meats have been identified, which may pose human cancer risk. [8] HCAs develop a powerful carcinogenic potential when activated by cytochrome P450 1A2-mediated oxidation of the amino group, which is followed by acetylation or sulfation to form direct-acting reactive mutagens that attack key elements in DNA. [9] When fed to rats, several of these HCAs can induce cancer of the mammary glands, colon, and pancreas.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer - Organizational sentence [5] Answer [6] Answer [7] Answer (Summary) [8] Answer [9] Answer
"What is the difference between LED, LCD, Plasma and LED LCD TVs? [1] Plasma [2] TVs are full of tiny compartments of gas. [3] When a voltage reaches the gas, the gas is excited into a plasma state containing mercury, and the voltage triggers the mercury to emit UV rays. [4] The rays pass through red, green, and blue phosphor cells in each pixel on the screen, creating a color image with the light produced by the pixels. [5] LCD TV pixels do not produce their own light like plasma TV pixels, so they use a backlight instead. [6] When the backlight is turned on, it sends a voltage to the pixels that rotates them, turning them to either let the backlight's light through and make an image or block the light to show black. [7] Older LCD TVs used Cold-Cathode Fluorescent Lamps (CCFLs) as a backlight, but newer ones use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instead and are called LED LCDs. [8] LED TVs are the same as LED LCDs since they function the same way LCD TVs do, but they use LED lights around the edges of the screen or covering the back panel rather than CCFLs.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer [7] Answer (Summary) [8] Answer (Summary)

[3] Since the cycle is automated by the autonomic nervous system, it is hard to detect normally, but it becomes more evident when you are sick. [4] When your nose is inflamed, tissues on the congested side are swollen from increased blood flow to that side of the nose. [5] The blood flow is directed to one side for several hours before the nasal cycle redirects it to the other side, making it more noticeable as the clogged feeling follows the switch than it would be for an uncongested nose.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary)

[1] While both are forms of entertainment and sometimes relaxation, the experience of binging TV is very different from watching a movie. [2] A TV show stimulates brain activity, making you alert, and you are likely invested in the story if you are binge watching a show. [3] TV shows often leave hooks at the end of an episode, giving the viewer a reason to continue onto the next episode. [4] This means that even after an episode's climax, there will be another component of the plot to keep you stimulated. [5] Movies, on the other hand, can be exhausting even before you press play. [6] Once you have found a TV show you like, you can try it out and switch to a new show if you're unsatisfied after one episode, but movies involve a longer time commitment.

[1] When a bicycle is stationary, there are only two points of support between the bicycle and the ground with the base of support being a line segment. [2] But in order for an object to have a stable base of support, three contact points with the ground are necessary. [3] When a bicycle is moving, those two points of support, the part of each wheel touching the ground, are now being expanded because the wheels are in movement with steering allowing those points of support to be moved around to adjust to the center of gravity, therefore balancing the bike.

"Why do people in all old voice recordings have the same ""old timey"" accents? [1] The ""old-timey"" announcer accent is called the Transatlantic or the Mid-Atlantic accent. [2] Some believe it came about due to the poor quality of microphones and loudspeakers in the early days of radio. [3] Speakers had to enunciate clearly, use frequent emphasis, and avoid bass tones, which technology at the time reproduced ineffectively. [4] The accent gets its name because it combines American English and British English, so speakers can be understood on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

"What is the difference between sigma bonds and pi bonds? [1] A sigma bond is a chemical bond formed by the linear or co-axial overlapping of the atomic orbitals of two atoms. [2] A pi bond is a type of covalent bond that exists between atoms where the electrons are on top and bottom of the axis connecting the nuclei of the joined atoms. [3] It is formed by the parallel or lateral overlapping of the atomic orbitals. [4] The differences between sigma and pi bonds are that: [5] Sigma bonds are formed by head-to-head overlapping of orbitals, whereas pi bonds are formed by lateral overlapping. [6] Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds. [7] Sigma bonds can be formed between both s and p orbitals whereas pi bonds are mostly formed between p and d orbitals. [8] The single covalent bonds between atoms are sigma bonds. [9] When there are multiple bonds between atoms, pi bonds can be seen. [10] Pi bonds result in unsaturated molecules.

"how are different types of cheese made? [1] Differences among types of cheese can generally be attributed to the origin of the milk used, the type(s) of molds and bacteria added, and the length(s) of ageing. [2] Most cheese is made from cow's milk, but milk from other animals, particularly goats and sheep, is also used. [3] The composition of milk can depend on the type and breed of animal, the season and geographic location, and the health and nutrition of the animal. [4] Additionally, different molds or bacteria are added depending on whether the cheese is soft ripened or hard. [5] Soft ripened cheeses such as Camembert and Brie have a mold added to the surface. [6] This mold produces a protein-digesting enzyme that breaks down the curd during ripening, creating a runny texture. [7] Harder cheeses can be made using either mesophilic starter bacteria or thermophilic starter bacteria. [8] Swiss cheese varieties made using thermophilic starter bacteria can withstand higher processing temperatures, and the subsequent bacterial growth creates the characteristic gas hole or ""eyes."" [9] Hard cheeses may also be cut more finely and pressed longer and harder during processing to release more moisture. [10] Finally, differences in the ageing or ripening process lead to differences in moisture and flavor. [11] Some cheeses may be aged for only several days, while others may be aged up to 2 years. [12] As the ageing period increases, the cheese loses more moisture, develops a stronger flavor and becomes harder and more crumbly in texture.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Organizational sentence [7] Answer [8] Answer - Example [9] Answer [10] Answer [11] Answer - Example [12] Auxiliary Information

"Why oil and gas rigs may cause earthquake and falls? [1] Extracting oil and gas from shale rock involves cracking, or fracturing, a layer of underground rock with a high-pressure mix of water, sand, and chemicals, a process known as fracking. [2] As the oil and gas are released, those injection fluids and briny water also come up. [3] That wastewater is later disposed of in what are called injection wells, or sometimes disposal wells. [4] It's the rapid injection of fluid during wastewater disposal, not the fracking process itself, which usually causes earthquakes. [5] The number of earthquakes is increasing in regions where fracking is common. [6] In fact, 20% of the earthquakes in the central United States may be attributed to just four of these wells. [7] And injected fluids in high-volume wells triggered earthquakes over 30 km away.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Auxiliary Information
"Why do some planets form rings while others form moons? [1] There are several different scientific theories about why some planets have rings and others have moons. [2] One theory is that, when the solar system formed from gas and space dust particles, the space dust formed clumps that became planets. [3] The remaining dust formed moons around some planets, but it was too close to other planets to form stable bodies and formed rings instead. [4] Another idea relates to the planets' proximity to the sun. [5] It's possible that rings, being made of frozen dust, couldn't form on planets closer to the heat of the sun. [6] Some scientists have proposed that the gravitational pull of a planet is the reason for rings or moons. [7] If dust was close to the planet when it formed, the gravitational pull was too strong for the dust to gather into a moon, so it dispersed into a wider ring. [8] A nearby moon or comet driving the planet's gravitational forces could also have interrupted the dust forming a moon and causing it to spread into a ring. [9] One last theory is that the giant planets had the mass and gravity to form miniature solar-system-like disks around themselves and pull in passing objects as irregular moons to form an eccentric ring instead of a system of moons with stable orbits. [10] Smaller planets nearer to the sun were made up of less material and had less space dust around them, so they formed moons through collisions that broke chunks off the planets and sent them into orbit.",[1] Answer - Organizational sentence [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer [7] Answer [8] Answer [9] Answer (Summary) [10] Answer (Summary)

"Why is it that a fully buffered YouTube video will buffer again from where you click on the progress bar when you skip a few seconds ahead? [1] When YouTube buffers a video, both your computer and the YouTube server have to load the video data. [2] If the YouTube server is overloaded with users, the server may be unable to transfer data fast enough to maintain the buffer constantly. [3] Skipping ahead can cause a hiccup in the connection because the YouTube server cannot stream the data to your computer fast enough. [4] When this happens, rather than the server providing a constant, smooth buffer, it has to refresh the buffer to reload the data. [5] This can also happen when your internet connection cannot handle the amount of data being streamed from the server all at once, so it buffers but has to reload repeatedly to maintain the buffer.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer [5] Answer

[3] Years later, as the division between the two was breaking down, the East German government rewrote their constitution and held free elections rather than appointing a head of state. [4] During the reunification that joined West and East Germany, the Chancellor also mandated that the united country had to join NATO, further pressing their status as a democracy rather than a controlled communist government.

"Why doesn't it thunder during snow storms? [1] Thunder can occur while it is snowing, sleeting, or even during freezing rain. [2] It is a very rare and unusual occurrence, but thunder snow is known to happen in mid-latitude climates, in the United States. [3] Thunder snow can happen in three different instances. [4] The first example is when a thunderstorm is on the edge of a cold front or a warm front where the precipitation in the atmosphere takes the form of snow. [5] The second instance is when there is a synoptic snowstorm that allows for conditions that cause lightning and thunder to occur. [6] The third one is called the lake effect where a thunderstorm is produced by cold air passing over warmer water, which produces snow squalls that then connect to the thunderstorm. [7] Lake-effect snowstorms have narrow clouds shaped more like ordinary thunderstorms. [8] When the air above the initial cloud layer is relatively cool and dry, and when the added cooling and lifting is strong, a shallow layer just above the original flat cloud can become unstable.

"Why are countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia seemingly unfazed (or otherwise not extremely worried) by the recent drastic drop in oil prices, but Venezuela's economy is quickly becoming one of the worst in the world, due mainly to the same drop in oil? [1] The oil-rich nations in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Yemen, and Oman, account for about 3.4 percent of the world’s total land surface. [2] However, these countries contain around 38 percent of the world’s total natural gas reserves and 48 percent of the total known reserves of crude oil. [3] When people think about the Middle East, they think about oil. [4] According to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, around 27 percent of the world’s current oil production is sourced from this region. [5] Because the Middle East produces oil so cheaply, it is not as vulnerable to changes in price.

[4] Taking right turns conserves fuel, decreases driving time, and avoids risks and delays, saving the UPS millions of gallons of gas each year.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Answer [4] Answer
"When you're looking for something for a long time, how are you able to be staring right at it, but not see it? [1] Schotomas are mental blind spots. [2] If, for example, someone says, ""Please get the salt,"" and as you walk into the next room, you say, ""But I don’t know where it is."" [3] After looking for a few minutes, you call out, ""I can’t find the salt."" [4] Then that someone walks up, takes the salt right off the shelf in front of you, and says, ""Look, it’s right here in front of you."" [5] When you said, ""I can’t,"" you gave your brain a command not to see the salt.

"Why does car sickness seem to hit the hardest when you look down at your phone, book, etc.? [1] The brain perceived motion because it receives information from the eyes, ears, and muscles. [2] When these parts send conflicting information, the brain doesn't know which is right and which is wrong, and this is what causes motion sickness. [3] An example of this is when reading a book while you are in a moving car. [4] To your eyes, the book is stationary while your inner ear and the rest of your body can feel a sense of motion. [5] This would likely cause car sickness.",[1] Answer [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example
"Why do mobile websites have a ""click here to continue reading"" button? [1] Mobile websites use a button to expand content and read more for several reasons. [2] The primary reason is that it allows them to compress content made for a desktop screen to fit a smaller mobile screen, letting users see the important parts of content more quickly. [3] The button also allows website administrators to track user engagement by watching what content gets the most clicks. [4] Websites administrators also track engagement through outside links to boost their SEO, since Google indexes mobile websites that use ""read more"" buttons differently than desktop websites. [5] A button to expand content can also be monetized. [6] It can increase website traffic, leading to a higher number of viewers with more paid advertisement clicks, or it can be used to hide content behind a paid subscription.",[1] Answer - Organizational sentence [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer
"How does a motorcycle ""wobble"" happen, and is it as hard to correct as it seems? [1] There are several different types of motorcycle wobbles—many of which stem from tire problems, speed, or an uneven weight distribution. [2] The front wheel may become imbalanced as it rotates, causing the wheel to shake. [3] This phenomenon is hard for the rider to control. [4] A speed wobble occurs with sudden changes in motion or elevation; the handlebars will start to shift side-to-side. [5] Another cause of bike instability is an uneven distribution of weight on the bike. [6] If you are shifted too far forward or backward, the bike may wobble.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Answer [6] Answer
"Why did humans start shaving? [1] Shaving dates back to approximately 100,000 BC when cavemen plucked their hair one at a time, sometimes using rocks or shells like tweezers to remove hairs more quickly. [2] It wasn’t until the Egyptian civilization, that the act of shaving became a daily regimen. [3] Egyptians believed that body hair was unclean and so men and women would completely remove their hair from the body, at times, using quicklime or arsenic as shaving lotions. [4] The upper class would bathe several times a day, shave their heads, and wore cooling wigs. [5] In the hot weather, body hair was a breeding ground for lice, fungal infections, and body odor causing bacteria. [6] In time, lack of hair on the head and body symbolized affluent status, and rich Egyptians employed their own barbers to stay clean.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer [6] Answer
"Why did we decide that certain words were ""bad"" and shouldn't be used in social settings? [1] Swear words, obscenities, and derogatory terms are some categories of words that society considers 'bad' and exempt from usage in social settings. [2] In a more definitive approach, courts presume harm from speech in cases involving discrimination or sexual harassment. [3] While the original justification for these obscenity laws was predicated on an unfounded assumption that speech can deprave or corrupt children, and it is important to note that there is little (if any) social science data demonstrating that a word is by itself harmful, it is also pertinent to consider the origin of some derogatory words and the context of their usage to understand why they should be unacceptable in social settings. [4] Examples include:
-Ape/Monkey: [5] These are considered offensive terms when used to describe a person of color because offensive comparisons of black people to apes date back hundreds of centuries, such as when scientists Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (a leading scientific text on race in its time), and they compared black people not to other (white) people but to chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. [6] They are now, justifiably, considered extremely derogatory slang. [7] -Savage: [8] When used as an adjective to describe acts of violence, this word is not considered offensive, but the use of 'savage' as a noun to describe people dates back to a time when Christopher Columbus was enslaving Native Americans and claiming their lands and work for his own. [9] The word became a slur used by white Europeans to describe Native American people. [10] The usage stuck around for hundreds of years, and it’s still a word that many indigenous peoples around the world find offensive.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer - Example [9] Answer - Example [10] Answer - Example
"Why do we use air filled tires and not tires made of solid rubber, that don't run the risk of going flat? [1] Passenger vehicles use air filled tires because air acts as a medium for contraction and expansion to the tire. [2] Air contracts and expands easily, therefore reducing wear and tear caused by the friction of rubber and the rims. [3] The air in the tires also absorbs impact of a hole or bump due to its high suspension abilities. [4] Tires made of solid rubber do not absorb vibrations because the solid construction of the tires makes them have no medium to absorb shocks, resulting in a rougher ride. [5] Tires made of rubber weigh more than air-filled tires, which increases the engine load to run the vehicle. [6] The car will accelerate slowly and waste fuel.",[1] Answer [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer
"How come even though the US economy is doing as good as it's been since 2007 and we aren't at war our national debt continues to increase? [1] The national debt level of the US measures how much money the federal government owes its creditors and is the level of federal debt held by the public. [2] The national debt continues to rise because the US government almost always spends more than it takes in. [3] As the US economy grows, the amount of revenue the government can use to pay its debts grows as well. [4] Additionally, a larger economy generally means that the country's capital markets will grow and the government can tap them to issue more debt. [5] As a result, the country's ability to pay off debt, and the effect that debt might have on the country's economy, is dependent on how large the debt is as a proportion of the overall economy, not the dollar amount.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Answer (Summary)
"Why isn't desalination an easy solution to the upcoming water shortages? [1] Desalination is a process by which highly pressurized sea water is funneled through tiny membrane filters and distilled into drinkable water. [2] Some see this process as a promising solution to global water shortages. [3] The more advanced water treatment plants around the world use Reverse Osmosis for filtration, which is a proven method for portable drinking water. [4] This process is a growing trend and gives hope to countries without rivers and reservoirs. [5] Still there are critics who point out the economic and environmental costs. [6] Desalinating ocean water is the most expensive form of fresh water, given the costs of collecting, distilling and distributing. [7] Desalination can also take a toll on ocean biodiversity. [8] For desalination to be a viable option, renewable energy needs to be used, costs need to be lowered, and environmental protection laws need to be in place for marine life.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Answer [6] Answer (Summary) [7] Answer [8] Answer
"how is a heavy duty clog cleaner able to work on a significant amount of standing water? [1] Most heavy duty clog cleaners contain strong chemicals to clear the clog in the drain. [2] All chemical reactions involve moving electrons, and drain cleaners either take or give electrons to the clogging substance and produce heat to clear the clog. [3] Drain cleaners that contain lye and caustic potash, give electrons to the clogging substance, releasing heat and turning grease into soap-like substance that’s easily dissolved. [4] These clog cleaners are heavier than water, so they can reach the clog through standing water. [5] Oxidizing drain cleaners contain bleach, peroxides and nitrates. [6] These chemicals oxidize organic material in the clog by taking electrons. [7] This cleaner is also heavier than water, so it can move through standing water, and release heat to clear the clog.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Auxiliary Information [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Auxiliary Information [7] Answer

"What is it about greenhouse gases that makes them greenhouse gases? [1] Greenhouse gases absorb infrared radiation. [2] Gases that absorb more radiation have broader absorption profiles, meaning they can absorb a wider spectrum of wavelengths. [3] When infrared radiation hits a molecule like carbon dioxide, the molecule's bonds bend and vibrate. [4] The molecule gains kinetic energy, which may be transmitted to other molecules and cause the atmosphere to heat up. [5] Other gases, like oxygen and nitrogen do not absorb infrared radiation.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer [4] Answer [5] Auxiliary Information
"What have we discovered about the planets/moons/sun in our solar system over the last 50 years? [1] While most planets and significant moons were discovered prior to the 1970s, astrophysicists have continued to discover moons within the last 50 years. [2] Many moons have been found around Saturn and Jupiter, such as Kowal and Thermisto, which were discovered in 1974 and 1975, respectively. [3] Additionally, new information has been learned about the planets in our solar system as a result of various missions. [4] A couple decades after the Apollo missions, we learned how similar Venus is to Earth while also learning that it is inhabitable. [5] The Mariner 10 mission explored Mercury in the early 1970s, and from this we learned that Mercury has a magnetic field and an atmosphere that is full of helium. [6] More recently, we have discovered much about other aspects of our solar system beyond the planets and their moons.

"Why does smoking tobacco cause cancer, but smoking marijuana does not? [1] Smoking tobacco causes cancer because the smoke it produces carries at least 70 kinds of carcinogens. [2] Carcinogens are chemicals that damage DNA, which affects cell reproduction and can produce abnormal cells that grow into cancer. [3] When marijuana or cannabis is smoked, it produces many of the same carcinogens as tobacco. [4] While it is still uncertain how much of a cancer risk marijuana smoke is, breathing the smoke will inhale carcinogens and spread them into the bloodstream, so more research is needed to know if smoking marijuana will cause cancer.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Auxiliary Information [3] Answer [4] Answer (Summary)
"Why are steering wheels placed on the left or right side of a car instead of the middle? [1] There are various explanations why center-placed steering wheels would be impractical. [2] Seating is one reason, with difficulties in fitting passengers comfortably. [3] The steering column is another issue since it would essentially be blocked by the engine. [4] Visibility would be difficult, especially around corners, and the rearview mirror would also be awkward and impractical. [5] Getting in and out of the vehicle would be pretty effortful, to say the least. [6] A surprising reason as to why our steering wheels are positioned on the left in America is due to teamsters, those who drove teams of horses with wagons in tow during the pre-Industrial Revolution days. [7] Since most people are right-handed, this enabled the drivers to hold the whips with their right hands as they sat on the horse on the left.

"How can someone put me in to jail if i am not guilty? [1] Experts estimate that a staggering 46,000 to 230,000 innocent people are wrongfully imprisoned. [2] Innocent people end up in prison for a wide variety of reasons, including bad police work. [3] Most police are honest, but some have been known to hide, alter or fabricate evidence, lie on the stand, cut deals in turn for bogus testimony, intimidate and threaten witnesses, coerce confessions, or manipulate eyewitness identifications. [4] Similarly, some prosecutors have been known to hide exculpatory evidence, encourage witnesses to commit perjury, lie to jurors, judges, and defense lawyers, use the testimony of bogus experts, or ignore relevant evidence beneficial to the accused. [5] False confessions coerced through abusive interrogation techniques are another reason that innocent citizens are imprisoned. [6] In fact, of the 330 people who were exonerated by DNA evidence between 1989 to 2015, about 25 percent gave bogus confessions after lengthy interrogations.",[1] Auxiliary Information [2] Answer - Organizational sentence [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Auxiliary Information
"When you get gut pain (like stomach cramps?), why is it you tend to curve into a ball and keep your feet warm, why and how does it relieve the pain ? [1] Curling into the fetal position is a ""natural defensive"" position that alleviates stomach aches due to both psychological and physiological reasons. [2] Being in the fetal position makes people feel warm and safe. [3] That's why humans hunch up when they receive bad news, are stressed out, or are in pain. [4] In the case of stomach flu or food poisoning, a person's bowels speed up to flush out the toxins.

"If I am not supposed to clean my ears deep with a q-tip, why does it feel so good and sometimes clear my sinuses? [1] When you clean your ears with a q-tip, it may feel good because the ear is an area that is seldom touched. [2] You may also be stimulating your Vagus nerve, which can create the sensation of pleasure. [3] However, sticking a q-tip into your ear is both unnecessary and tentatively dangerous. [4] Earwax prevents your ears from drying out and stops bacteria from getting too deep within your ear. [5] It will naturally clear itself out, but when you shove a q-tip into your ear, you may be disrupting this natural process by pushing the earwax in further in.
