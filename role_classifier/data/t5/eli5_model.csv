"What are the glaring holes in the data supporting global warming? [2] But there are two main problems: the fact that it's hard to make accurate predictions about the weather and the fact that the data supports predictions about the weather that were wrong decades ago. [3] There are many factors that can cause the data to be wrong, and some of them can be solved in certain ways. [4] But we don't know how to fix all of them. [5] The two biggest problems are that the predictions that are made are not always accurate. [6] The weather is complicated, and we can't predict everything. [7] So the predictions that are made about it are usually wrong. [8] We can't make a new prediction about it that's more accurate, because there's always a chance that the predictions that were wrong will be wrong in the future.

"What are the glaring holes in the data supporting global warming? [1] The main ones are the increasing rates of carbon emissions, and the fact that the oceans are warming. [3] But the ""holes"" in data support both of these things, and there is no clear indication that they are the cause of any of the other problems. [4] It's possible that there is a subtle connection, but it's not really clear if it's a factor or not. [5] There's also a suggestion that the ""Global Warming"" may be a consequence of human activities, but that's a bit more speculative. [7] It's certainly not an instant, predictable process, and it's hard to say what those things are going to do. [8] There's a bit of a mystery surrounding what those things are doing, and the scientific community doesn't really have a clear answer to that question.

"How did South Korea go from being a completely backwards and impoverished nation to one of the world's top economies in 60 years? [1] 1) World War II reduced spending on everything and the Korean war caused most of the country's GDP to shrink. [3] 2) After the war the government basically tried to crack down on corruption, which resulted in a strong economy and 2/3rds of the country's GDP rebounding from the Korean debt. [4] 3) The Korean educational system was incredibly well-funded. [5] Schools throughout the country got grants from the government. [6] With the help of wealthy American donors, schools were built by students for free. [7] 4) With the help of America and the USSR, much of North Korea's GDP recovered.

[4] The instinct to sneeze is so deeply ingrained in our brains that we can't help but start to sneeze when we look at something bright. [5] By looking at something bright, you are forcing your eyes to focus on something else, which in turn triggers the reflex to sneeze.

[2] It's easier to track exoplanets that pass near other planets, because they're easier to track, but also easier to track if they pass near other planets. [3] This allows the scientists to make sure they're in the right place at the right time. [4] 2. It's a way to study exoplanets that pass close to Earth.

"Why do maps always start with North America on the left and end with Asia on the right? [1] Because the early cartographers were Europeans, and the west was largely dominated by European cultures. [2] So it makes sense to have the western half of the map drawn from Europe, since the Europeans have been dominant for a long time. [3] The rest of the world was pretty much ignored by the Europeans, so they drew the map accordingly. [4] If you look at a lot of early maps, you'll see that the Western half of the map is usually drawn in the middle of the map, with Europe on the left, and Asia on the right. [5] So, the reason for this is that the Europeans were the dominant culture in Europe, and therefore the maps that used to be drawn were drawn to reflect that fact. [6] The problem is that there are some cultures that still don't use Europe as their main cultural center, and they still draw their maps from the western half of the map. [7] For example, Japan, which has always been a relatively minority culture, doesn't have a west-to-east map because it uses a different cultural center.

"Why do maps always start with North America on the left and end with Asia on the right? [1] Because the way the world was colonized, it was a western country. [2] So you have the western hemisphere (Europe, Asia, Africa) and the eastern hemisphere (America, Asia, Europe). [3] Because the world was largely western, the map would have drawn the western hemisphere (and thus, the Americas) to the top. [4] Because of this, the middle of the map is the ""East"" side of the map, and the top is the ""West"" side. [6] But that's how it was done, and that's how it's done in most countries. [7] I don't know why the English chose to put the centre at the top of the map, but I'm sure they had to because that's how they did it. [8] And it's how the world was usually understood to be, so it makes sense to put the center there, since that's where people had been accustomed to seeing the world.

"How is the Earth's core still hot 4.5 billion years into its existence? [1] The heat is generated by radioactive decay. [2] That means that the heat is generated by the decay of radioactive elements. [3] The decay is much slower than the creation of heat. [4] So, the earth is constantly losing heat, but it's gaining heat in the process. [7] This is also the reason why there are mountains and deserts on earth. [8] As the Earth gets bigger, the amount of material for the heat to be transferred into increases, and eventually the Earth is big enough that there's enough material for the heat to be transferred into, and it's hot enough to keep the heat generated from going into space. [9] That's also why the surface of the earth is brown, as the earth is always losing the heat that it's getting from radioactive decay.

"Why does the word 'liberal' refer to the left in the US? [1] Generally speaking the left-wing comes from classical liberalism. [3] Countries that became socialist during the 19th century were generally very liberal in economic policy (with a large emphasis on worker's rights) as opposed to the left-wing movements they developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. [4] As you can see from this paper, the government of Britain is also a liberal in economic policy and the former socialist regimes were fairly conservative in their economic policies. [5] As a result of these two reasons a lot of people mistakenly identify themselves as liberal. [6] The term comes from a reaction in the 16th century to the writings of Adam Smith (the founder of the economic system in Britain) which outlined the social ideas of the time. [7] Socialism in the 19th century was fairly limited.

[3] This is happening right now and the result of the study is working in the lab. [4] At all costs efficiency is a big concern in any research projects because there are costs associated with running a complex system and maintaining a large, complex environment that requires resources. [5] The space station is currently operating in a terribly constrained space where its only purpose is to research and replicate experiments and design solutions to their solutions. [6] If we could somehow isolate all of the water we use on the station then we could solve all of the problems and solve all of the problems that arise when we bring water into space. [7] But there is only so much space available at NASA so that is not going to happen anytime soon. [8] And this is also not a solved problem - we are simply running out of water to use and to design solutions for.

"why doesn't tin foil feel hot to the touch even while it is in the oven or on a grill? [2] The layer of foil between your hand and the knife is a much better conductor than air, so heat doesn't transfer. [3] Another factor is that the layer of foil is so thin, it doesn't have a lot of individual molecules that your skin can touch, so your brain can't detect any of the individual heat sources in the area. [4] Since it has a much lower density than air, it doesn't allow the heat to transfer very effectively, because the atoms are too far apart for you to actually feel any of the individual heat on the surface. [5] Finally, aluminum foil is basically one big sheet of metal, so it doesn't have any individual thermal conductors, so the heat loss from your skin is all radiated away in your entire body. [6] On top of that, aluminum foil is very thin, so it cools off a lot faster than, say, say, wood, which is thick and has lots of individual (and often very large) individual heat sources, and therefore can transfer heat well, giving you a convection current.",[2] Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer [5] Answer (Summary) [6] Answer (Summary),1yo6bv,p90_predicted,"[2] Answer,Answer (Summary) [3] Answer (Summary) [4] Answer,Answer (Summary) [5] Answer,Answer (Summary) [6] Answer (Summary)",model_generated
"If silver is the best conductor of any metal, why do we most often use gold? [1] Silver is used because it is soft and ductile. [2] It's also relatively easy to work with. [3] That's why we use it in electronics and a lot of other things. [4] That's also why we use it as a plating for old metal, because it's soft and ductile enough to be applied without corroding it. [5] It's also why we use it as a coating for a really old wall. [6] That's why we use it as a paint, because it's soft and ductile enough to be applied without corroding it. [7] And of course, there are tons of other applications that we use for it. [8] The real reason gold is used is because it is the most abundant metal in the universe. [10] Gold is also very malleable, which means that it can be bent and stretched out very easily. [11] That makes it useful for making things out of gold, like jewellery and electronics.

"Why don't airplanes broadcast their exact GPS coordinates continously to some central authority who records them so that they can be easily found if they crash? [1] Many international flight plans rely on several separate communication systems.

[3] You also have to understand that where GPS satellites are located is far from central. [4] If you are travelling from NY to LA, GPS satellites will all be in the area they belong to. [5] If you travel from London to Moscow, a couple of dozen GPS satellites would be outside that area. [6] If you fly from New York to Hawaii, it would be near enough to Hawaii to be a navigational aid. [7] The US also has an extensive military system which uses it for all kinds of things, including tracking people across the country.

"In the US, why is it allowed to potentially expose your child and other's children to deadly diseases through vaccination exemptions but other state mandated laws, such as vehicle child restraints or smoking age-limits, are non-negotiable? [1] It is because the United States has a very strong tradition of anti-vaccine rights. [2] That means that any attempt to make an exception to the rule would be met with massive resistance. [3] This means that any attempt to make a national law would likely be blocked by the overwhelming majority of Americans. [4] It would also mean that the federal government would have to go through the hassle of making an exception to the rule and changing the law to fit the needs of the majority of Americans. [5] This is not something that is likely to happen anytime soon. [6] It would take years to get enough support for a law to pass and if that happens it would be a disaster.

"In the US, why is it allowed to potentially expose your child and other's children to deadly diseases through vaccination exemptions but other state mandated laws, such as vehicle child restraints or smoking age-limits, are non-negotiable? [1] I think it's a matter of perspective. [2] In the US, the government is given the power to decide what to enforce, but the individual states have the right to make their own laws. [3] For example, I'm in Colorado, and the state legislature decided that alcohol use was a violation of federal law. [4] So I can go out and get alcohol, but I can't do that in Colorado. [5] However, I can still get a license from the state sheriff. [6] This is the same with car restrictions. [7] I can't go out and buy a car, but I can go out and buy a license from the state trooper. [8] I can also go out and buy a license from the state trooper if I'm in Colorado. [9] Obviously, this doesn't work for every situation, but for example, a state trooper might be able to enforce a federal law, but they can't enforce a state law. [10] In this case, the federal government has the right to decide what laws to enforce. [11] This is similar to the difference between a ""right to swing"" and a ""right to smoke"".

"Why do wounds itch when healing, prompting us to scratch and potentially re-damage the area? [1] I'm not a doctor or a biologist but from what I've heard it's because the area is inflamed and the itching is a natural response to the irritation.

[6] If someone knows a better answer please post it. [7] EDIT: I forgot to add, as someone who has had wounds that itch (burns, cuts etc.) [8] I believe it's a self defense mechanism. [9] You're basically warning your brain that there's a potential threat that needs to be dealt with. [10] So it triggers the pain response.

"Why do wounds itch when healing, prompting us to scratch and potentially re-damage the area? [1] From what I understand (not sure) in the brain, there is a specific patch of neurons that mediate itching. [3] So what happens is that the areas of the brain responsible for itching tend to fire, and so you think there's something REALLY annoying you, so you scratch. [4] And then those areas of the brain that mediate pain (ie. [5] The hypothalamus) fire, and so you itch. [6] And so on. [7] If you take a microscopic fragment of skin and make a very small hole in it, that chunk of skin gets infected, and can cause itching. [9] In addition to that, that's why they often say not to scratch an open wound - it releases immune system cells that could be causing infection to the area that caused the injury.

"Why is Ebola more dangerous than other diseases? [1] Ebola is generally associated with an inferior immune system, making it a more dangerous disease. [2] Which is why it is rarely caught by the public except when in person. [3] Unlike a lot of other diseases it does not have an obvious cure, so if your body can't fight it off you're left with your life in the hands of an incurable virus. [4] Also it is usually transmitted through bodily fluids. [5] This is a result of the higher mortality rates caused by Ebola. [6] The amount of victims compared to the number of victims of other diseases makes it a greater deal of a stressor. [7] The death toll of Ebola is high, so it's only natural that more people suffer from it. [8] Also it was originally a disease that was primarily confined to Africa. [9] So Africa had less of a population and a weaker immune system than the rest of the world, so these diseases spread quickly and it was a very bad disease in Africa.

"What happens when we jam a finger? [1] When you push on a finger, you break some of the bones.

[4] But if you do this repeatedly, it can become permanently deformed. [5] If you do this enough times, the bone will break, and you will have a painful amputation. [6] This is why doctors always recommend that you get a doctor to do it to you, and to make sure you do not break a bone that you can't fix. [7] This is because the bone is so hard that it will heal without any help from the doctor, and you can't fix it without breaking the bone.

"Why are plane crashes such a big deal? there are 21 plane crashes worth of death each day in the world from traffic accidents. [1] Planes are huge, and if one is involved in a crash it can be catastrophic for everyone on board. [2] That's why it's such a big deal when a major commercial disaster occurs. [3] There are also major passenger aircraft accidents, and these are even more catastrophic. [4] But the biggest reason is simply that they are so big, and they happen so often, and so far so rarely, that it's just not a huge deal. [5] There are many, many other factors that contribute to this, but they're pretty much the same thing. [6] So to answer your question, it's because they're big and they happen so often, and they're so rare, that it's a big deal. [7] And the reason it's so big is because of how intercontinental planes are designed. [8] Plane crashes are caused by a bunch of different things, but the biggest factor is the shape of the plane. [9] It's the shape of the plane that makes the plane crash, not the size of the plane. [10] Airliners are designed to be aerodynamic, which means that they take in air and push it out the back.

"why is pee only yellow or clear? [1] Urine is just the water that your body has excreted from your body. [2] It's not clear because it's the waste products of your body, and contains a large amount of proteins, minerals, and other stuff that doesn't belong in your body. [4] The hormones are what cause your pee to be yellow and clear, and the metabolites are what cause your pee to be yellow and clear. [6] So why are your urine and your poo different colors? [7] Well, because of the differences in the types of waste products excreted. [8] When your body is excreting waste products, it will usually have two types of waste products.

"why is pee only yellow or clear? [1] Urine is clear because it is the byproduct of the breakdown of a waste product called urobilin. [2] Urobilin is a dark brown substance that is mostly made up of bilirubin and other chemicals. [3] This waste product is what causes the color of urine. [4] In humans, urobilin is broken down by an enzyme called bilirubin. [5] Bilirubin is a waste product that can be made by many different types of cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and other cells that need to make urine. [6] The body makes lots of different waste products, and these waste products can be different colors. [7] One of the main products of the breakdown of bilirubin is urobilin.

"Why is New Zealand the 'freest' country? [1] Separated from the monarchy, they have free elections, a relatively small minimum wage, and protectionist policies such as the parliamentary one.

[6] That said, a meteor would most certainly be out there waiting to be hit.

"Why in older movies when characters are conversing outside, it sounds like they're dubbed or theres no distance to their voice?

"with underground fires like Centralia or the place in Virginia which inspired Silent Hill, why can't they be put out by just pumping lots and lots of water into the mine? [1] This would require a lot of energy to do. [2] The power required to pump water into the mine is way too much for any one person to do, and it would be nearly impossible to make the water go anywhere else. [3] This is not a problem with large coal mines, because they are often underground, and the water would have to be pumped up by pumping power into the mines, which is not very efficient. [4] If you were to try and pump water into a Zentorno, which is an airliner, you'd need a lot more power than you could get from a coal mine.

"why does rain in the tropics come down heavy for an hour and then vanish, but in europe the rain is mostly light and can last all day? [1] In the tropics, the ground absorbs a lot of the rain, and it's going to fall in heavy rain for a while, before it evaporates away. [3] In the United States, the ground isn't as flat as it used to be, and the air is much denser, so the water tends to condense out of the air and form clouds. [6] Also, the way clouds form is dependent on the air pressure. [7] In the tropics, the air pressure is much lower than in the United States, so the water can't condense out of the air as easily, and it can still be heavy.

[3] This is to help us conserve energy. [4] So if we stayed awake all day, we would burn more energy than we would use at night. [6] So, the body produces chemicals that keep us awake during the day and asleep at night. [8] There are some people who believe that humans evolved to stay awake during the day because we evolved to work during the day. [9] They say that this is because we needed to be able to gather food during the day and to hunt during the night.

[6] These clouds are often quite large, and can block out the sun. [7] This is what you see when you look at a contrail.

"Can the capacity of our brains be roughly measured in bytes? [1] No. [3] For example, your olfactory bulb is in the brain stem which in turn is in the hypothalamus which is part of the forebrain. [4] This is why when you smell something, the neurons in your olfactory bulb fire and give you the sensation of smell. [5] The neurons for your hearing are in the auditory cortex which is the part of the brain responsible for language and comprehension. [6] Technically your brain has about 1 billion neurons which would be more than a million times larger than the human brain. [7] Most brains would not be able to comprehend over the millions of neurons that would constitute the size of the human brain. [8] And if you took that a million times bigger, you would still have a problem with our understanding the human language. [9] TL;DR: Technically you can say that a person has about a billion neurons, but that number is in reality only around 0.0500 to 1 billion.

"Why is men's sport watched so so much more than women's? [1] I'm going to assume you mean why is it watched more than women's sports? [2] I'm not sure I can ELI5, but I'll try. [3] I think it's partly because women's sports are less popular in general, whereas men's sports are more popular. [5] As a result, women's sports have fewer people watching them, and therefore less viewers. [7] Therefore, they're more likely to have a more active participation in sports, and thus more viewers.

"How do flies constantly fly into hard objects at high speeds(walls, doors, windows, etc) but never manage to get hurt? [1] Flies are tiny, so their mass doesn't affect their movement very much. [2] They also have a low mass relative to their size. [3] They also have a low reaction speed. [4] So they don't have enough time to react to the force of the impact to cause injury. [9] Because of all of this, flies can fly into very hard objects without suffering any damage. [10] However, if they get hit, they can be seriously injured. [11] In addition, flies have very poor reaction times. [12] They can only react very quickly to a very small stimulus, and very little time to react to the larger stimulus.

"How do bugs in games occur? [1] Let's pretend you're a working robot that is working on a linear function. [2] It moves one of the pieces in the function one linear number of times. [3] So, for example, if the function ""Ax1"" moves one linear number of times, then ""Ax2"" moves one linear number of times. [4] So, that means ""Ax2"" moves one linear number of times, and ""Ax1"" moves one linear number of times. [5] You then place the object in the right position, it can move in the same linear direction as Ax2, but the object will not move in the correct direction, it will end up in the wrong place. [6] So, even though the thing is in the same place as ""Ax2"", it won't move anywhere because the exact same position it occupies does not exist. [7] With a bug, if the code for the object has incorrect instructions for how to move, it will never be able to perform its task. [8] Thus, the game will crash when a corrupted code results in a very wrong program being executed.

"how is hd tv easily sent over the air with no loading/buffering but streaming hd video online takes a good internet connection and high bandwidth? [1] Many people have asked about the difference in latency between streams and home video, but it's worth mentioning that a streaming video *has* to load up - your TV only has to stream the right part of the video at once, so it doesn't matter if your TV's speed is far from being ideal. [2] So what happens is that streaming at the higher bandwidth lets you stream entire parts of the video *constantly* and if your TV has very little bandwidth available, it can't send the next part, because it can't send the video at full speed. [3] For example, let's say there is a 20 second delay between when you stream the last part of a movie, and when you want to watch the next part. [4] Now you can easily hook up to Netflix to watch the whole movie at once (if you have the bandwidth) because Netflix sends it all at once (the same way you could just hook up to your TV to watch the whole movie at once).

"Do planes have speed limits? [1] A plane's speed limit is based on air resistance, not on the air itself. [2] The speed limit of a plane is based on the amount of air the plane needs to push off of to move at a constant speed. [3] Air resistance increases with speed, so at the speeds that planes fly, there will always be a point where the maximum amount of air can be pushed off of the plane by the engine without it damaging the plane. [4] So as long as the plane can push enough air off of the engine and the plane has enough fuel to push enough air off the plane, it will be fine at cruising speed. [5] The thing to remember is, even at cruising speed, air resistance has to be overcome. [6] This is why you have a climbing wind at high altitudes as you gain speed. [7] That wind can't push enough air off the engine to keep you going at a constant speed. [8] It's like if you put a garden hose out of the window. [9] It will slow down, but the rate of decrease in water pressure is what is keeping you going.

"Why are polar bears and grizzly bears considered different species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring? [1] Well bear in mind that the simple answer to ""why are separate species considered different species"" is to say that it doesn't have to be. [2] For example, the two species of bear are the Canis Lupus Familiaris and the Canis Lupus Familiaris Hinaurorae. [3] For species that are closely related, they can breed even if the chromosome count doesn't match up, because one half of the chromosome won't match up with the other half of the chromosome, resulting in an offspring with incomplete chromosomes. [4] With humans, there's nothing to reproduce, so the resulting offspring doesn't have any chromosome, which gives it no genetic diversity and potentially no species. [5] With wolves, there's more to reproduce (although it still doesn't make a viable offspring) so you're right that they are different species. [6] For polar bears and grizzly bears, they are clearly different species because there is no genetic difference between the two species, and so they can breed. [7] But again, because they're closely related, they can breed even if the chromosome count doesn't match up, resulting in an offspring with incomplete chromosome, and therefore no species.",[1] Answer [2] Answer - Example [3] Answer [4] Auxiliary Information [5] Auxiliary Information [6] Answer [7] Answer (Summary),7ndrvj,p90_random,"[1] Answer [2] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [3] Answer,Answer (Summary) [4] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [5] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [6] Answer,Answer (Summary) [7] Answer,Answer (Summary)",model_generated
"Why are criminal cases in the military processed in military courts instead of public courts despite the military being funded by taxes? [1] Because the military is funded by taxpayers, and civilian courts are not mandatory, so they can be set up in civilian courts (which are run by civilian prosecutors). [2] Also, there's no law requiring military courts to be ""open"" or ""impartial,"" and so they are pretty much not. [3] That being said, there are some restrictions on how they can be used. [4] For example, the military can only be used for internal investigations, which means that the military cannot use military courts for civil matters. [5] For example, if a soldier is injured while doing duty, they can't be tried by a civilian court (unless it's a self-defense court, but that's another story), because that would violate the separation of powers (and the fact that the military is a federal government agency, and so can have a lot of legal powers). [6] Finally, it's important to note that military courts are very different from civilian courts. [7] A military court is a court of law, whereas civilian courts are courts of law.

[2] There's actually an outer layer of protection which helps keep water out but I'm not sure if you've seen it yet. [3] You can probably see it if you pull a coin out of a water tank. [4] It won't fall out though because it's got a seal at the bottom. [5] The force of the water pushing on the penny lifts it up and then the same thing happens with the ear canal. [8] When you're submerged you can feel your Eustachian tube closing which is one of the reasons why your ears don't pop when you walk outside or under water (although there's a water leak out there somewhere if you forget to change your water cap). [9] If you're swimming underwater and get hit by a wave or get hit by a rock or a big bubble, you're fine. [10] You're fine because water can't get into your Eustachian tube or your ear.",[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [8] Answer [9] Answer - Example [10] Answer,vcll8,p90_predicted,"[1] Answer (Summary) [2] Answer,Auxiliary Information [3] Answer - Example [4] Answer - Example [5] Answer - Example [8] Answer,Auxiliary Information [9] Answer - Example,Auxiliary Information [10] Answer",model_generated
"If some people can live without parts of their brains, why do people instantly die when they're shot in the head? [1] It depends on how much of the brain is damaged. [5] If a bullet hits the small portion of the brain that controls movement and controls organs, you're going to die. [6] If a bullet hits the small portion of the brain that controls vomiting, you're going to live. [7] If a bullet hits the small portion of the brain that controls your liver, you're going to live. [8] If a bullet hits the small portion of the brain that controls your heart, you're going to die. [9] There are probably more reasons that will cause someone to die quickly.",[1] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer - Example [9] Auxiliary Information,x6vdt,p90_predicted,"[1] Answer (Summary) [5] Answer - Example [6] Answer - Example [7] Answer - Example [8] Answer,Answer - Example [9] Auxiliary Information,Miscellaneous",model_generated
