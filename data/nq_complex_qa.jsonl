The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between de Laboulaye , a staunch abolitionist and Frédéric Bartholdi , a sculptor . In after - dinner conversation at his home near Versailles , Laboulaye , an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War , is supposed to have said : `` If a monument should rise in the United States , as a memorial to their independence , I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort -- a common work of both our nations . '' The National Park Service , in a 2000 report , however , deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet , and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870 . In another essay on their website , the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences , `` With the abolition of slavery and the Union 's victory in the Civil War in 1865 , Laboulaye 's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States . In order to honor these achievements , Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France .

{"q_id": -3954096959833325710, "question": "what is the main difference between lymph and interstitial fluid", "answer": " Lymph is the fluid that circulates throughout the lymphatic system . The lymph is formed when the interstitial fluid ( the fluid which lies in the interstices of all body tissues ) is collected through lymph capillaries . It is then transported through larger lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes , where it is cleaned by lymphocytes , before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein , where it mixes back with the blood .  Since the lymph is derived from the interstitial fluid , its composition continually changes as the blood and the surrounding cells continually exchange substances with the interstitial fluid . It is generally similar to blood plasma , which is the fluid component of blood . Lymph returns proteins and excess interstitial fluid to the bloodstream . Lymph may pick up bacteria and bring them to lymph nodes , where they are destroyed . Metastatic cancer cells can also be transported via lymph . Lymph also transports fats from the digestive system ( beginning in the lacteals ) to the blood via chylomicrons .  Interstitial fluid forms at the arterial ( coming from the heart ) end of capillaries because of the higher pressure of blood compared to veins , and most of it returns to its venous ends and venules ; the rest ( up to 10 % ) enters the lymph capillaries as lymph . Thus , lymph when formed is a watery clear liquid with the same composition as the interstitial fluid .

Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed , or `` fixed '' , into a usable form to be taken up by plants . Between 5x10 and 10x10 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes , but most fixation is done by free - living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs . These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia , which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds . Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo - nitrogenase , found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea . Mo - nitrogenase is a complex two - component enzyme that has multiple metal - containing prosthetic groups . An example of free - living bacteria is Azotobacter . Symbiotic nitrogen - fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes ( such as peas , alfalfa , and locust trees ) . Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant , producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates . Because of this relationship , legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen - poor soils . A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses . Today , about 30 % of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber - Bosch process , which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source ( natural gas or petroleum ) into ammonia .

With the passage of the Bill of Rights , it stamped out once and for all any possibility of a Catholic monarchy , and ended moves towards absolute monarchy in the British kingdoms by circumscribing the monarch 's powers . These powers were greatly restricted ; he or she could no longer suspend laws , levy taxes , make royal appointments , or maintain a standing army during peacetime without Parliament 's permission -- to this day the Army is known as the `` British Army '' not the `` Royal Army '' as it is , in some sense , Parliament 's Army and not that of the King .

With DMA , the CPU first initiates the transfer , then it does other operations while the transfer is in progress , and it finally receives an interrupt from the DMA controller when the operation is done . This feature is useful at any time that the CPU can not keep up with the rate of data transfer , or when the CPU needs to perform work while waiting for a relatively slow I / O data transfer . Many hardware systems use DMA , including disk drive controllers , graphics cards , network cards and sound cards . DMA is also used for intra-chip data transfer in multi-core processors . Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices with much less CPU overhead than computers without DMA channels . Similarly , a processing element inside a multi-core processor can transfer data to and from its local memory without occupying its processor time , allowing computation and data transfer to proceed in parallel .

The Love wave is a result of the interference of many shear waves ( S -- waves ) guided by an elastic layer , which is welded to an elastic half space on one side while bordering a vacuum on the other side . In seismology , Love waves ( also known as Q waves ( Quer : German for lateral ) ) are surface seismic waves that cause horizontal shifting of the Earth during an earthquake . Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911 . They form a distinct class , different from other types of seismic waves , such as P - waves and S - waves ( both body waves ) , or Rayleigh waves ( another type of surface wave ) . Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P - or S - waves , but faster than Rayleigh waves .

{"q_id": -3056467550980725703, "question": "what are the nonpolar and polar phases in tlc", "answer": " Separation of compounds is based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding sites on the stationary phase . For instance , if normal - phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase , it can be considered polar . Given two compounds that differ in polarity , the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is , therefore , better able to displace the mobile phase from the available binding sites . As a consequence , the less polar compound moves higher up the plate ( resulting in a higher R value ) . If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents , it becomes better at binding to the polar plate and therefore displacing solutes from it , so all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate . It is commonly said that `` strong '' solvents ( eluents ) push the analyzed compounds up the plate , whereas `` weak '' eluents barely move them . The order of strength / weakness depends on the coating ( stationary phase ) of the TLC plate . For silica gel - coated TLC plates , the eluent strength increases in the following order : perfluoroalkane ( weakest ) , hexane , pentane , carbon tetrachloride , benzene / toluene , dichloromethane , diethyl ether , ethyl acetate , acetonitrile , acetone , 2 - propanol / n - butanol , water , methanol , triethylamine , acetic acid , formic acid ( strongest ) . For C18 - coated plates the order is reverse . In other words , when the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is non-polar , the method is normal - phase as opposed to reverse - phase . This means that if a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane as the mobile phase is used , adding more ethyl acetate results in higher R values for all compounds on the TLC plate . Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate . An eluotropic series can be used as a guide in selecting a mobile phase . If a reversed order of running of the compounds is desired , an apolar stationary phase should be used , such as C18 - functionalized silica .

It is an active circuit which converts an analog input signal to a digital output signal . The circuit is named a `` trigger '' because the output retains its value until the input changes sufficiently to trigger a change . In the non-inverting configuration , when the input is higher than a chosen threshold , the output is high . When the input is below a different ( lower ) chosen threshold the output is low , and when the input is between the two levels the output retains its value . This dual threshold action is called hysteresis and implies that the Schmitt trigger possesses memory and can act as a bistable multivibrator ( latch or flip - flop ) .

{"q_id": 6320885114563008801, "question": "what is the rule for when easter is", "answer": " For most of their history Christians have calculated Easter independently of the Jewish calendar . In principle , Easter falls on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the northern spring equinox ( the paschal full moon ) . However , the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation . The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March ( previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox ) . The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar , which again varied in different areas . While Easter now falls at the earliest on the 15th of the lunar month and at the latest on the 21st , in some areas it used to fall at the earliest on the 14th ( the day of the paschal full moon ) and at the latest on the 20th , or between the sixteenth and the 22nd . The last limit arises from the fact that the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th ( the eve of the Passover ) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth . The `` computus '' is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March , and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year . The synodic month had already been measured to a high degree of accuracy .

{"q_id": 5011051341742964036, "question": "why are my eyes always red in photos", "answer": " In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals . The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils . Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because , in the dark , the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment .

President James Monroe strove to downplay partisan affiliation in making his nominations , with the ultimate goal of national unity and eliminating parties altogether from national politics . The period is so closely associated with Monroe 's presidency ( 1817 -- 1825 ) and his administrative goals that his name and the era are virtually synonymous .

That is , the electrostatic force can be attractive or repulsive , depending on the mutual orientation of the molecules . When molecules are in thermal motion , as they are in the gas and liquid phase , the electrostatic force is averaged out to a large extent , because the molecules thermally rotate and thus probe both repulsive and attractive parts of the electrostatic force .

A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a clade , a groups of organisms with a last common ancestor . There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that branch off from other lines . The lines can be traced back to where they branch off . These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor ( not an actual entity ) which can be inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it . This hypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about the order of evolution of various features , adaptation , and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors .

The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing , cutting the overall length by 3.73 metres ( 12 ft 3 in ) . Consequently , the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two . The bulk - cargo door was replaced by an aft container door , which can take in reduced height LD3 - 45 containers . Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics ; otherwise the aircraft is largely unchanged . Power is provided by the CFM56 - 5A or V2500 - A5 , derated to 98 kN ( 22,000 lbf ) , with option for 105 kN ( 24,000 lbf ) thrust . ", "wiki_title": "Airbus A320 family", "split": "train"}

This is thought to be the most common mechanism of action for natural selection because most traits do not appear to change drastically over time . Stabilizing selection commonly uses negative selection ( a.k.a. purifying selection ) to select against extreme values of the character . Stabilizing selection is the opposite of disruptive selection . Instead of favoring individuals with extreme phenotypes , it favors the intermediate variants . Stabilizing selection tends to remove the more severe phenotypes , resulting in the reproductive success of the norm or average phenotypes . This means that most common phenotype in the population is selected for and continues to dominate in future generations .

The design also makes the weapon easy to maneuver in cramped spaces , a feature sought by military close quarters combat units , law enforcement SWAT team users , and home defense purposes . With modern pump action / magazine tube shotguns , the shorter barrel limits the magazine capacity of the weapon due to the magazine tube protruding beyond the barrel .

{"q_id": 313533728960387847, "question": "what are in the nucleus of an atom", "answer": " The nucleus of an atom consists of neutrons and protons , which in turn are the manifestation of more elementary particles , called quarks , that are held in association by the nuclear strong force in certain stable combinations of hadrons , called baryons . The nuclear strong force extends far enough from each baryon so as to bind the neutrons and protons together against the repulsive electrical force between the positively charged protons . The nuclear strong force has a very short range , and essentially drops to zero just beyond the edge of the nucleus . The collective action of the positively charged nucleus is to hold the electrically negative charged electrons in their orbits about the nucleus . The collection of negatively charged electrons orbiting the nucleus display an affinity for certain configurations and numbers of electrons that make their orbits stable . Which chemical element an atom represents is determined by the number of protons in the nucleus ; the neutral atom will have an equal number of electrons orbiting that nucleus . Individual chemical elements can create more stable electron configurations by combining to share their electrons . It is that sharing of electrons to create stable electronic orbits about the nucleus that appears to us as the chemistry of our macro world . ", "wiki_title": "Atomic nucleus", "split": "train"}

The compound was effective against malaria infection in experimental animals . In 1905 , Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann identified a spirochaete bacterium ( Treponema pallidum ) as the causative organism of syphilis . With this new knowledge , Ehrlich tested Compound 606 ( chemically arsphenamine ) on a syphilis - infected rabbit . He did not recognise its effectiveness . Sahachiro Hata went over Ehrlich 's work and found on 31 August 1909 he found that the rabbit , which had been injected with Salvarsan 606 was cured using only a single dose , the rabbit showed no adverse effect . ( The normal treatment procedure of syphilis at the time involved two to four years routine injection with mercury . ) Ehrlich , after receiving this information , performed experiments on human patients with the same success . After convincing clinical trials , the compound number 606 was given a trade name `` Salvarsan '' , a portmanteau for `` saving arsenic '' . Salvarsan was commercially introduced in 1910 , and in 1913 , a less toxic form `` Neosalvarsan '' ( Compound 914 ) was released in the market . These drugs became the principal treatments of syphilis until the arrival of penicillin and other novel antibiotics towards the middle of the 20th century .

{"q_id": -7942678667666370069, "question": "how does the nuclear charge of elements in the same period affect their size", "answer": " In single - electron atoms , the average separation of an electron from the nucleus is determined by the subshell it belongs to , and decreases with increasing charge on the nucleus ; this in turn leads to a decrease in atomic radius . In multi-electron atoms , the decrease in radius brought about by an increase in nuclear charge is partially offset by increasing electrostatic repulsion among electrons . In particular , a `` shielding effect '' operates : i.e. , as electrons are added in outer shells , electrons already present shield the outer electrons from nuclear charge , making them experience a lower effective charge on the nucleus . The shielding effect exerted by the inner electrons decreases in the order s > p > d > f . Usually , as a particular subshell is filled in a period , atomic radius decreases . This effect is particularly pronounced in the case of lanthanides , as the 4f subshell which is filled across these elements is not very effective at shielding the outer shell ( n = 5 and n = 6 ) electrons . Thus the shielding effect is less able to counter the decrease in radius caused by increasing nuclear charge . This leads to `` lanthanide contraction '' .

Convergent evolution creates analogous structures that have similar form or function but were not present in the last common ancestor of those groups . The cladistic term for the same phenomenon is homoplasy . The recurrent evolution of flight is a classic example , as flying insects , birds , pterosaurs , and bats have independently evolved the useful capacity of flight . Functionally similar features that have arisen through convergent evolution are analogous , whereas homologous structures or traits have a common origin but can have dissimilar functions .

These protected areas , if fully enforced , aim to prevent an estimated one billion tons of carbon from being transferred to the atmosphere through deforestation by the year 2015 .

{"q_id": 7610716534142592071, "question": "difference between common source common gate and common drain amplifier", "answer": " In electronics , a common - source amplifier is one of three basic single - stage field - effect transistor ( FET ) amplifier topologies , typically used as a voltage or transconductance amplifier . The easiest way to tell if a FET is common source , common drain , or common gate is to examine where the signal enters and leaves . The remaining terminal is what is known as `` common '' . In this example , the signal enters the gate , and exits the drain . The only terminal remaining is the source . This is a common - source FET circuit . The analogous bipolar junction transistor circuit may be viewed as a transconductance amplifier or as a voltage amplifier . ( See classification of amplifiers ) . As a transconductance amplifier , the input voltage is seen as modulating the current going to the load . As a voltage amplifier , input voltage modulates the amount of current flowing through the FET , changing the voltage across the output resistance according to Ohm 's law . However , the FET device 's output resistance typically is not high enough for a reasonable transconductance amplifier ( ideally infinite ) , nor low enough for a decent voltage amplifier ( ideally zero ) . Another major drawback is the amplifier 's limited high - frequency response . Therefore , in practice the output often is routed through either a voltage follower ( common - drain or CD stage ) , or a current follower ( common-gate or CG stage ) , to obtain more favorable output and frequency characteristics . The CS -- CG combination is called a cascode amplifier . ", "wiki_title": "Common source", "split": "train"}

Effects of surface - based anticyclones include clearing skies as well as cooler , drier air . Fog can also form overnight within a region of higher pressure . Mid-tropospheric systems , such as the subtropical ridge , deflect tropical cyclones around their periphery and cause a temperature inversion inhibiting free convection near their center , building up surface - based haze under their base .

Newly forming European states , through voyages of discovery , were looking for alternative trade routes in the 15th and 16th centuries , which allowed the European powers to build vast , new international trade networks .

{"q_id": 5830617203016745758, "question": "how do you get mercury poisoning from fish", "answer": " The consumption of fish is by far the most significant source of ingestion - related mercury exposure in humans and animals . Mercury and methyl mercury are present in only very small concentrations in seawater . However , they are absorbed , usually as methyl mercury , by algae at the start of the food chain . This algae is then eaten by fish and other organisms higher in the food chain . Fish efficiently absorb methyl mercury , but excrete it very slowly . Methyl mercury is not soluble and therefore not excreted . Instead , it accumulates , primarily in the viscera , although also in the muscle tissue . This results in the bioaccumulation of mercury , in a buildup in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels : zooplankton , small nekton , larger fish , and so on . The older that such fish become , the more mercury they may have absorbed . Anything that eats these fish within the food chain also consumes the higher level of mercury that the fish have accumulated . This process explains why predatory fish such as swordfish and sharks or birds like osprey and eagles have higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone . Species on the food chain can amass body concentrations of mercury up to ten times higher than the species they consume . This process is called biomagnification . For example , herring contains mercury levels at about 0.1 parts per million , while shark contains mercury levels greater than 1 part per million .

Older seafloor is therefore colder than new seafloor , and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy . If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust , a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed . The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust . Today , the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge . Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted . However , the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean . The Pacific is also home to one of the world 's most active spreading centers ( the East Pacific Rise ) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm / yr . The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a `` textbook '' slow - spreading center , while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading .

Early in the series , the Doctor explains to his companion Bill Potts ( Pearl Mackie ) that he is guarding a vault on Earth as a result of a promise , which is revealed by a flashback in `` Extremis '' to be a promise to watch over Missy , who is captive in the vault after the Doctor spared her from execution on a faraway world , and Missy promised to become good . In `` The Lie of the Land '' , the Doctor 's crew visits Missy in the safe to gain intelligence on an enemy she had defeated in the past . Her demeanour seems little changed and she has low regard for human life , but in the episode 's coda , she sheds remorseful tears for all the millions of deaths she has caused . Missy 's gradual reform is indicated in several more episodes . In `` Empress of Mars '' , she returns the Doctor 's TARDIS to Mars to rescue the Doctor and Bill ; in `` The Eaters of Light '' , she has been released from her cage by the Doctor to run repairs on his TARDIS , which is isomorphically locked so that she can not pilot it . The Doctor attempts to test Missy 's reformation in series finale `` World Enough and Time '' / `` The Doctor Falls '' by sending Missy , Bill , and Nardole ( Matt Lucas ) on a rescue mission aboard a space ship experiencing time dilation near a black hole . However , they soon run into Missy 's past incarnation aboard the ship , where the Master ( John Simm ) has initiated the genesis of new Cybermen . Trapped aboard the ship together , Missy finds her loyalties torn between her promise to the Doctor and the lure of her old self . After initially betraying the Doctor , she later chooses to stand alongside him against a Cyberman army , stabbing her past self and sending him back to his TARDIS to regenerate , concluding her life has led to her becoming the Doctor 's ally . Enraged at the idea of ever becoming the Doctor 's ally , the Master shoots Missy with his laser screwdriver , disabling her regeneration and seemingly killing her .

Moreover , it is clear that a true lisp would not give rise to the systematic distinction between / s / and / θ / that characterizes Standard Peninsular pronunciation .

The result can be unnaturally high concentrations of some chemicals , such as arsenic , sulfuric acid , and mercury over a significant area of surface or subsurface . Runoff of mere soil or rock debris - although non-toxic - also devastates the surrounding vegetation . The dumping of the runoff in surface waters or in forests is the worst option here . Submarine tailings disposal is regarded as a better option ( if the soil is pumped to a great depth ) . Mere land storage and refilling of the mine after it has been depleted is even better , if no forests need to be cleared for the storage of the debris . There is potential for massive contamination of the area surrounding mines due to the various chemicals used in the mining process as well as the potentially damaging compounds and metals removed from the ground with the ore . Large amounts of water produced from mine drainage , mine cooling , aqueous extraction and other mining processes increases the potential for these chemicals to contaminate ground and surface water . In well - regulated mines , hydrologists and geologists take careful measurements of water and soil to exclude any type of water contamination that could be caused by the mine 's operations . The reducing or eliminating of environmental degradation is enforced in modern American mining by federal and state law , by restricting operators to meet standards for protecting surface and ground water from contamination . This is best done through the use of non-toxic extraction processes as bioleaching . If the project site becomes nonetheless polluted , mitigation techniques such as acid mine drainage ( AMD ) need to be performed . ", "wiki_title": "Environmental impact of mining", "split": "train"}

In 1987 , new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could give rise to a larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant , but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct . This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts . Both extinction and speciation - a new species splitting from an older one - could occur together during periods of climatic extremes . Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin and further proposed that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of C. dirus in North America , and that because of the similarities in their skull shapes that C. lupus gave rise to the C. dirus hypermorph due to abundant game , a stable environment , and large competitors . Nowak , Kurten and Berta disagreed with Goulet and proposed that C. dirus was not derived from C. lupus . The three noted paleontologists Xiaoming Wang , R.H. Tedford and R.M. Nowak have all proposed that C. dirus had evolved from C. ambrusteri , with Nowak stating that there were specimens from Cumberland Cave , Maryland that indicated C. ambrusteri diverging into C. dirus .

{"q_id": -477975201484547977, "question": "why does a glass prism disperse white light", "answer": " Light changes speed as it moves from one medium to another ( for example , from air into the glass of the prism ) . This speed change causes the light to be refracted and to enter the new medium at a different angle ( Huygens principle ) . The degree of bending of the light 's path depends on the angle that the incident beam of light makes with the surface , and on the ratio between the refractive indices of the two media ( Snell 's law ) . The refractive index of many materials ( such as glass ) varies with the wavelength or color of the light used , a phenomenon known as dispersion . This causes light of different colors to be refracted differently and to leave the prism at different angles , creating an effect similar to a rainbow . This can be used to separate a beam of white light into its constituent spectrum of colors . A similar separation happens with iridescent materials , such as a soap bubble . Prisms will generally disperse light over a much larger frequency bandwidth than diffraction gratings , making them useful for broad - spectrum spectroscopy . Furthermore , prisms do not suffer from complications arising from overlapping spectral orders , which all gratings have . ", "wiki_title": "Prism", "split": "train"}

{"q_id": 3350097251333439673, "question": "after jupiter formed how did its orbit change over time", "answer": " The giant planets ( Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune ) formed further out , beyond the frost line , which is the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid . The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets , allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium , the lightest and most abundant elements . Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4 M within about 3 million years . Today , the four giant planets comprise just under 99 % of all the mass orbiting the Sun . Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line . Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material , it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun . In effect , the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~ 5 AU from the Sun . This excess material coalesced into a large embryo ( or core ) on the order of 10 M , which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever - increasing rate . Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass , growth proceeded very rapidly , reaching about 150 Earth masses ~ 10 years thereafter and finally topping out at 318 M.

{"q_id": 8788126018236056454, "question": "why do we have red eyes in pictures", "answer": " In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals . The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils . Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because , in the dark , the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment .

Evidence suggesting that Arctic wolves depend more on hares claims that the mature wolf population paralleled the increase of hares rather than muskoxen availability . The study goes on to say that degree of reliance between the two sources of food is uncertain and that the amount of consumption between the two species depends on the season and year . Debate continues when seasonal and diet of young wolves is discussed . According to one study , muskox calves serve as a primary food source because the needs of pups are greater but another study suggests that `` when hares were much more plentiful ( Mech , 2000 ) , wolves commonly fed them to their pups during summer . '' These differences may be attributed to location as well . Polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves , though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs .

Morning sun heats the ground which in turn heats the marine layer over the land areas . This creates convective turbulence within the marine layer as well as evaporation of any clouds within it . The marine layer clears back toward the coast , usually by noon . By mid-afternoon , inland areas have heated sufficiently to decrease the air pressure and increase the onshore flow . By late afternoon , the wind increases and begins to cool the onshore marine layer , allowing the fog and low clouds offshore to progress inland without evaporating . Cloudiness streams in over the Bay and through the various gaps . How far the clouds can penetrate inland depends on the depth of the marine layer and the strength of the cooling winds . As night falls and inland areas cool down , the winds usually decrease , but the fog and clouds remain wherever they have blown in until the following morning when the cycle repeats .

Absence of glucose will `` turn off '' catabolite repression . When glucose levels are low the phosphorylated form of EIIA accumulates and consequently activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase , which will produce high levels of cAMP . cAMP binds to catabolite activator protein ( CAP ) and together they will bind to a promoter sequence on the lac operon . However , this is not enough for the lactose genes to be transcribed . Lactose must be present inside the cell to remove the lactose repressor from the operator sequence ( transcriptional regulation ) . When these two conditions are satisfied , it means for the bacteria that glucose is absent and lactose is available . Next , bacteria start to transcribe the lac operon and produce β - galactosidase enzymes for lactose metabolism . The example above is a simplification of a complex process . Catabolite repression is considered to be a part of global control system and therefore it affects more genes rather than just lactose gene transcription .

By contrast , a land breeze or offshore breeze is the reverse effect : dry land also cools more quickly than water and , after sunset , a sea breeze dissipates and the wind instead flows from the land towards the sea .

Linguists did not consider sign language to be true `` language '' , but rather something inferior . Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe , a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption . Aided by the civil rights movement of the 1960s , Stokoe argued for manualism , the use of sign language in deaf education . Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication , and even devised a transcription system for ASL .

Also , it is possible that the skin lesion does not take the form of a rash but it may include papules , blisters , vesicles or even a simple red area . The main difference between the rash caused by allergic contact dermatitis and the one caused by irritant contact dermatitis is that the latter tends to be confined to the area where the trigger touched the skin , whereas in allergic contact dermatitis the rash is more likely to be more widespread on the skin .

Kudzu was introduced to the Southeast in 1883 at the New Orleans Exposition . The vine was widely marketed in the Southeast as an ornamental plant to be used to shade porches , and in the first half of the 20th century , kudzu was distributed as a high - protein content cattle fodder and as a cover plant to prevent soil erosion . It was cultivated by Civilian Conservation Corps workers as a solution for the erosion during the Dust Bowl . The Soil Erosion Service recommended the use of kudzu to help control erosion of slopes which led to the government - aided distribution of 85 million seedlings and government - funded plantings of kudzu which paid $19.75 per hectare . By 1946 , it was estimated that 1,200,000 hectares ( 3,000,000 acres ) of kudzu had been planted . When boll weevil infestations and the failure of cotton crops caused farmers to abandon their farms , kudzu plantings were left unattended . The climate and environment of the Southeastern United States allowed the kudzu to grow virtually unchecked . In 1953 the United States Department of Agriculture removed kudzu from a list of suggested cover plants and listed it as a weed in 1970 . By 1997 , the vine was placed on the `` Federal Noxious Weed List '' .

This period of the war was concluded in 421 BC , with the signing of the Peace of Nicias . That treaty , however , was soon undermined by renewed fighting in the Peloponnese . In 415 BC , Athens dispatched a massive expeditionary force to attack Syracuse in Sicily ; the attack failed disastrously , with the destruction of the entire force , in 413 BC . This ushered in the final phase of the war , generally referred to either as the Decelean War , or the Ionian War . In this phase , Sparta , now receiving support from Persia , supported rebellions in Athens ' subject states in the Aegean Sea and Ionia , undermining Athens ' empire , and , eventually , depriving the city of naval supremacy .

{"q_id": 964501917789793709, "question": "why do your eyes get red in pictures", "answer": " In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals . The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils . Photographs taken with infrared light through night vision devices always show very bright pupils because , in the dark , the pupils are fully dilated and the infrared light is not absorbed by any ocular pigment .

Leonardo Bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his History of the Florentine People ( 1442 ) . Bruni and later historians argued that Italy had recovered since Petrarch 's time , and therefore added a third period to Petrarch 's two . The `` Middle Ages '' first appears in Latin in 1469 as media tempestas or `` middle season '' . In early usage , there were many variants , including medium aevum , or `` middle age '' , first recorded in 1604 , and media saecula , or `` middle ages '' , first recorded in 1625 .

The drought came in three waves , 1934 , 1936 , and 1939 -- 1940 , but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years . With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains , farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade ; this had displaced the native , deep - rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds .

If the dealer does not bust , each remaining bet wins if its hand is higher than the dealer 's , and loses if it is lower . If a player receives 21 on the 1st and 2nd card it is considered a `` natural '' or `` blackjack '' and the player is paid out immediately unless dealer also has a natural , in which case the hand ties . In the case of a tied score , known as `` push '' or `` standoff '' , bets are normally returned without adjustment ; however , a blackjack beats any hand that is not a blackjack , even one with a value of 21 . Wins are paid out at 1 : 1 , or equal to the wager , except for winning , player blackjacks , which are traditionally paid at 3 : 2 ( meaning the player receives three dollars for every two bet ) , or one - and - a-half times the wager . Many casinos today pay blackjacks at less than 3 : 2 at some tables ; for instance , single - deck blackjack tables often pay 6 : 5 for a blackjack instead of 3 : 2 .

Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals , where it begins the chemical process of digestion . Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar , such as rice and potatoes , may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar . The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase ( alpha amylase ) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy . Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase . As diastase , amylase was the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated ( by Anselme Payen in 1833 ) .

{"q_id": -1985932377386898972, "question": "why is it necessary to heat a solvent in order to make a supersaturated solution", "answer": " Special conditions need to be met in order to generate a supersaturated solution . One of the easiest ways to do this relies on the temperature dependence of solubility . As a general rule , the more heat is added to a system , the more soluble a substance becomes . ( There are exceptions where the opposite is true ) . Therefore , at high temperatures , more solute can be dissolved than at room temperature . If this solution were to be suddenly cooled at a rate faster than the rate of precipitation , the solution will become supersaturated until the solute precipitates to the temperature - determined saturation point . The precipitation or crystallization of the solute takes longer than the actual cooling time because the molecules need to meet up and form the precipitate without being knocked apart by water . Thus , the larger the molecule , the longer it will take to crystallize due to the principles of Brownian motion . ", "wiki_title": "Supersaturation", "split": "train"}

These prevailing winds blow from the polar easterlies are one of the five primary wind zones , known as wind belts , that make up our atmosphere 's circulatory system . This particular belt of wind begins at approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude and reaches to the poles . When air moves near the poles , cold temperatures shrink the air . This promotes air from warmer latitudes to flow into the area , causing a polar high - pressure zone . Air from this high - pressure zone then rushes toward the low - pressure zone surrounding the sub-polar region .

Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister ( PMO ) , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions .

White light from the sun is made up of a combination of colors , which are broken apart by water droplets in a ' rainbow ' spectrum . Large quantities of water , even in a swimming pool , would appear blue as well . When light hits the water surface , the different colors are absorbed , transmitted , scattered , or reflected in differing intensities by water molecules and other so - called optically - active constituents in suspension in the upper layer of the ocean . The reason open ocean waters often appear blue is due to the absorption and scattering of light . The blue wavelengths of light are scattered , similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water . In water , absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue , thus red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue . Almost all sunlight that enters the ocean is absorbed , except very close to the coast . The red , yellow , and green wavelengths of sunlight are absorbed by water molecules in the ocean . When sunlight hits the ocean , some of the light is reflected back directly but most of it penetrates the ocean surface and interacts with the water molecules that it encounters . The red , orange , yellow , and green wavelengths of light are absorbed so that the remaining light we see is composed of the shorter wavelength blues and violets .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) .

This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) . An indirect free kick is also awarded to the opposing team when play is stopped to caution or send - off a player when no specific foul has occurred ( e.g. when play is stopped to caution a player for dissenting the decision of the referee ) .

An extremely thin ( molecular ) layer of thorium atoms forms on the outside of the wire 's carbonized layer and , when heated , serve as an efficient source of electrons . The thorium slowly evaporates from the wire surface , while new thorium atoms diffuse to the surface to replace them . Such thoriated tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours . The end - of - life scenario for a thoriated - tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of tungsten carbide and emission begins to drop off rapidly ; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end - of - life in a tube with this type of emitter . WAAY - TV in Huntsville , Alabama achieved 163,000 hours of service from an Eimac external cavity klystron in the visual circuit of its transmitter ; this is the highest documented service life for this type of tube . It has been said that transmitters with vacuum tubes are better able to survive lightning strikes than transistor transmitters do . While it was commonly believed that at RF power levels above approx. 20 kilowatts , vacuum tubes were more efficient than solid state circuits , this is no longer the case , especially in medium wave ( AM broadcast ) service where solid state transmitters at nearly all power levels have measurably higher efficiency . FM broadcast transmitters with solid state power amplifiers up to approx. 15 kW also show better overall mains - power efficiency than tube - based power amplifiers .

In the late 1960s , local hunters began to complain to their congressmen that there were too few elk , and the congressmen threatened to stop funding Yellowstone . Killing elk was given up as control method which allowed elk populations to again rise . As elk populations rose , the quality of the range decreased affecting many other animals .

When measuring all the photons emitted , the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other . When the Sun is low in the sky , atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow , red , orange , or magenta . Despite its typical whiteness , most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow ; the reasons for this are the subject of debate . The Sun is a G2V star , with G2 indicating its surface temperature of approximately 5,778 K ( 5,505 ° C , 9,941 ° F ) , and V that it , like most stars , is a main - sequence star .

{"q_id": -3780004465237792922, "question": "why two different elements cannot occupy the same box in the periodic table", "answer": " The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle which states that two or more identical fermions ( particles with half - integer spin ) can not occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously . In the case of electrons in atoms , it can be stated as follows : it is impossible for two electrons of a poly - electron atom to have the same values of the four quantum numbers : n , the principal quantum number , l , the angular momentum quantum number , m , the magnetic quantum number , and m , the spin quantum number . For example , if two electrons reside in the same orbital , and if their n , l , and m values are the same , then their m must be different , and thus the electrons must have opposite half - integer spin projections of 1 / 2 and − 1 / 2 . This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons , and later extended to all fermions with his spin -- statistics theorem of 1940 .

The pressure is relieved by allowing the pressurised fluid to flow from an auxiliary passage out of the system . The relief valve is designed or set to open at a predetermined set pressure to protect pressure vessels and other equipment from being subjected to pressures that exceed their design limits . When the set pressure is exceeded , the relief valve becomes the `` path of least resistance '' as the valve is forced open and a portion of the fluid is diverted through the auxiliary route . The diverted fluid ( liquid , gas or liquid -- gas mixture ) is usually routed through a piping system known as a flare header or relief header to a central , elevated gas flare where it is usually burned and the resulting combustion gases are released to the atmosphere . As the fluid is diverted , the pressure inside the vessel will stop rising . Once it reaches the valve 's reseating pressure , the valve will close . The blowdown is usually stated as a percentage of set pressure and refers to how much the pressure needs to drop before the valve reseats . The blowdown can vary from roughly 2 -- 20 % , and some valves have adjustable blowdowns . ", "wiki_title": "Relief valve", "split": "train"}

Women were prohibited by some state constitutions and laws from voting , leading to Susan B. Anthony attempting to vote in New York in the 1872 Presidential election as an act of civil disobedience . In 1876 and later , some states passed Jim Crow laws that limited the rights of African - Americans . Important Supreme Court decisions that undermined these amendments were the Slaughter - House Cases in 1873 , which prevented rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment 's privileges or immunities clause from being extended to rights under state law ; and Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 which originated the phrase `` separate but equal '' and gave federal approval to Jim Crow laws . The full benefits of the Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth amendments were not realized until the Supreme Court decision in Brown v.

Industrialisation , however , dramatically increased European demand for Asian raw materials ; and the severe Long Depression of the 1870s provoked a scramble for new markets for European industrial products and financial services in Africa , the Americas , Eastern Europe , and especially in Asia . This scramble coincided with a new era in global colonial expansion known as `` the New Imperialism , '' which saw a shift in focus from trade and indirect rule to formal colonial control of vast overseas territories ruled as political extensions of their mother countries . Between the 1870s and the beginning of World War I in 1914 , the United Kingdom , France , and the Netherlands -- the established colonial powers in Asia -- added to their empires vast expanses of territory in the Middle East , the Indian Subcontinent , and South East Asia . In the same period , the Empire of Japan , following the Meiji Restoration ; the German Empire , following the end of the Franco - Prussian War in 1871 ; Tsarist Russia ; and the United States , following the Spanish -- American War in 1898 , quickly emerged as new imperial powers in East Asia and in the Pacific Ocean area .

{"q_id": 8127721155255741308, "question": "how does the grain size effect the strength of a metal", "answer": " Under an applied stress , existing dislocations and dislocations generated by Frank -- Read sources will move through a crystalline lattice until encountering a grain boundary , where the large atomic mismatch between different grains creates a repulsive stress field to oppose continued dislocation motion . As more dislocations propagate to this boundary , dislocation ' pile up ' occurs as a cluster of dislocations are unable to move past the boundary . As dislocations generate repulsive stress fields , each successive dislocation will apply a repulsive force to the dislocation incident with the grain boundary . These repulsive forces act as a driving force to reduce the energetic barrier for diffusion across the boundary , such that additional pile up causes dislocation diffusion across the grain boundary , allowing further deformation in the material . Decreasing grain size decreases the amount of possible pile up at the boundary , increasing the amount of applied stress necessary to move a dislocation across a grain boundary . The higher the applied stress needed to move the dislocation , the higher the yield strength . Thus , there is then an inverse relationship between grain size and yield strength , as demonstrated by the Hall -- Petch equation . However , when there is a large direction change in the orientation of the two adjacent grains , the dislocation may not necessarily move from one grain to the other but instead create a new source of dislocation in the adjacent grain . The theory remains the same that more grain boundaries create more opposition to dislocation movement and in turn strengthens the material .

Homeostasis , from the Greek homeo , means `` similar , '' while stasis means `` stand ; '' thus , `` standing at about the same level . '' ( The term was not coined as `` homostasis '' or `` standing the same '' because internal states are frequently being disturbed and corrected , thus rarely perfectly constant . ) Allostasis was coined similarly , from the Greek allo , which means `` variable ; '' thus , `` remaining stable by being variable '' ( Sterling & Eyer 1988 ; Klein 2004 ) . Allostatic regulation reflects , at least partly , cephalic involvement in primary regulatory events , in that it is anticipatory to systemic physiological regulation ( Sterling & Eyer 1988 ; Schulkin 2003 ) .

There can be disqualification if a hurdler knocks a hurdle into an opponents lane and it is judged to have interfered with the opponent 's ability to run the race . There are now specifications for the tipping weight of a hurdle ( the weights need to be adjusted to correspond with the height of the hurdle ) so hitting a hurdle theoretically slows down the rhythm of the hurdler . However , pushing the hurdle with one 's hands or running out of one 's lane as a result of hitting the hurdle is cause for disqualification . While hitting hurdles is not generally considered desirable , a few sprint hurdlers have succeeded despite knocking over many hurdles . Contact with hurdles can decrease speed and also result in disruption of a hurdler 's technique . Some coaches suggest if you lightly `` kiss '' the hurdle with the side of the leg closest to the hurdle , it can help with the runners speed by keeping the runner closer to the ground .

{"q_id": -5692413700948106425, "question": "odd degree and even degree of a graph", "answer": " The degree sequence problem is the problem of finding some or all graphs with the degree sequence being a given non-increasing sequence of positive integers . ( Trailing zeroes may be ignored since they are trivially realized by adding an appropriate number of isolated vertices to the graph . ) A sequence which is the degree sequence of some graph , i.e. for which the degree sequence problem has a solution , is called a graphic or graphical sequence . As a consequence of the degree sum formula , any sequence with an odd sum , such as ( 3 , 3 , 1 ) , can not be realized as the degree sequence of a graph . The converse is also true : if a sequence has an even sum , it is the degree sequence of a multigraph . The construction of such a graph is straightforward : connect vertices with odd degrees in pairs by a matching , and fill out the remaining even degree counts by self - loops . The question of whether a given degree sequence can be realized by a simple graph is more challenging . This problem is also called graph realization problem and can either be solved by the Erdős -- Gallai theorem or the Havel -- Hakimi algorithm .

Boron is responsible for the blue color . Color in diamond has two additional sources : irradiation ( usually by alpha particles ) , that causes the color in green diamonds , and plastic deformation of the diamond crystal lattice . Plastic deformation is the cause of color in some brown and perhaps pink and red diamonds . In order of increasing rarity , yellow diamond is followed by brown , colorless , then by blue , green , black , pink , orange , purple , and red . `` Black '' , or Carbonado , diamonds are not truly black , but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance . Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration , while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless . Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the crystal lattice , known as a carbon flaw . The most common impurity , nitrogen , causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present . The Gemological Institute of America ( GIA ) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the normal color range , and applies a grading scale from `` D '' ( colorless ) to `` Z '' ( light yellow ) .

Because this flooding happened fairly predictably , the Egyptians were able to develop their agricultural practices around it . The water levels of the river would rise in August and September , leaving the floodplain and delta submerged by 1.5 meters of water at the peak of flooding . This yearly flooding of the river is known as inundation . As the floodwaters receded in October , farmers were left with well watered and fertile soil in which to plant their crops . The soil left behind by the flooding is known as silt and was brought from Ethiopian Highlands by the Nile . Planting took place in October once the flooding was over , and crops were left to grow with minimal care until they ripened between the months of March and May . While the flooding of the Nile was much more predictable and calm than other rivers , such as the Tigris and Euphrates , it was not always perfect . High floodwaters were destructive and could destroy canals that were made for irrigation . Lack of flooding created a potentially greater issue because it left Egyptians suffering from famine .

Funding came from financiers throughout the Northeast , and from Europe , especially Britain . The federal government provided no cash to any other railroads . However it did provide unoccupied free land to some of the Western railroads , so they could sell it to farmers and have customers along the route . Some cash came from states , or from local governments that use money as a leverage to prevent being bypassed by the main line . Larger sound came from the southern states during the Reconstruction era , as they try to rebuild their destroyed rail system . Some states such as Maine and Texas also made land grants to local railroads ; the state total was 49 million acres . The emerging American financial system was based on railroad bonds . Boston was the first center , but New York by 1860 was the dominant financial market .

It is also less commonly known as a balanced parliament or a legislature under no overall control . If the legislature is bicameral , and the government is responsible only to the lower house , then `` hung parliament '' is used only with respect to that chamber . It is the objective of parliamentary systems for the parliament to be able to form a stable government , preferably one that lasts until the next election . This requires the government to be able to muster up sufficient votes in parliament to pass important legislation , especially the government 's budget . It also needs sufficient votes to defeat votes of no - confidence in the government . If the state of the parliament is such that a majority government can not be formed , the government may be referred to as a `` minority government '' . The term hung parliament is used mainly in systems with two parties or two party blocs . Most general elections in such a system will result in one or other party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government ; a `` hung parliament '' is an exception to this pattern , and may by some be considered anomalous or undesirable , and by others ideal as it blocks the dangers of absolute power .

He was a French Girondist and abolitionist during the French Revolution who controlled 7,000 French troops in Saint - Domingue during part of the Haitian Revolution . His official title was Civil Commissioner . Within a year of his appointment , his powers were considerably expanded by the Committee of Public Safety . Sonthonax believed that Saint - Domingue 's whites , most of whom were of Spanish descent , were royalist or separatist conservatives attached to independence or Spain as a way to preserve the slave plantations . He attacked the military power of the white settlers , and by doing so , he alienated the colonists from the French government . Many gens de couleur , mixed - race residents of the colony , asserted that they could form the military backbone of Saint - Domingue if they were given rights , but Sonthonax rejected this view as outdated in the wake of the August 1791 slave uprising . He believed that Saint - Domingue would need ex-slave soldiers among the ranks of the colonial army if it was to survive . Although he did not originally intend to free the slaves , by October 1793 he ended slavery in order to maintain his own power . ", "wiki_title": "Saint-Domingue", "split": "train"}
{"q_id": -8332099883566680787, "question": "what causes cells with the same dna to differentiate", "answer": " Each specialized cell type in an organism expresses a subset of all the genes that constitute the genome of that species . Each cell type is defined by its particular pattern of regulated gene expression . Cell differentiation is thus a transition of a cell from one cell type to another and it involves a switch from one pattern of gene expression to another . Cellular differentiation during development can be understood as the result of a gene regulatory network . A regulatory gene and its cis - regulatory modules are nodes in a gene regulatory network ; they receive input and create output elsewhere in the network . The systems biology approach to developmental biology emphasizes the importance of investigating how developmental mechanisms interact to produce predictable patterns ( morphogenesis ) . ( However , an alternative view has been proposed recently . Based on stochastic gene expression , cellular differentiation is the result of a Darwinian selective process occurring among cells . In this frame , protein and gene networks are the result of cellular processes and not their cause . See : Cellular Darwinism ) ", "wiki_title": "Cellular differentiation", "split": "train"}

Negative numbers represent opposites . If positive represents a movement to the right , negative represents a movement to the left . If positive represents above sea level , then negative represents below sea level . If positive represents a deposit , negative represents a withdrawal . They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency . A debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset , a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase . If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses , then one may choose to distinguish between those senses -- perhaps arbitrarily -- as positive and negative . In the medical context of fighting a tumor , an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage . Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero , such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature . The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic . For example , − ( − 3 ) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing . ", "wiki_title": "Negative number", "split": "train"}

The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture , thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats ; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water - dependent microorganisms that cause decay . In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun , and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds ( especially common for the preparation of stockfish ) , or in warm ovens , cellars , attics , and at times even in living quarters . Subjecting food to a number of chemical processes such as smoking , salting , brining , conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer . Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors . Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months . Butter tended to be heavily salted ( 5 -- 10 % ) in order not to spoil . Vegetables , eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars , containing brine and acidic liquids ( lemon juice , verjuice or vinegar ) . Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat , in which it was then stored . Microbial modification was also encouraged , however , by a number of methods ; grains , fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens , and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk .

{"q_id": -2579440704025205547, "question": "where did the idea of concentric castles come from", "answer": " Surrounding fortresses or towns with a series of defensive walls where the outer walls are lower than the inner walls is something that has been found in fortifications going back thousands of years to cultures like the Assyrians , Persians , Ancient Egyptians and Babylonians . The ancient city of Lachish , a place in Israel , was excavated and found to consist of multiple walls that were famously illustrated in Assyrian art documenting their successful siege of the city . The Byzantines also famously constructed the Walls of Constantinople which featured double layers of walls through most of its perimeter and a moat . The city of ancient Babylon also featured multiple layers of fortifications , famously seen in the Ishtar Gate . However , the relationship of the concentric castle to other forms of fortification is complex . Perhaps the earliest example of a concentric castle is the crusader castle of Belvoir , whose very regular rectangular layout has been described by Nicolle as one castrum nested inside another . Historians ( in particular Hugh Kennedy ) have argued that the concentric defence arose as a response to advances in siege technology in the crusader states from the 12th to the 13th century . The outer wall protected the inner one from siege engines , while the inner wall and the projecting towers provided flanking fire from crossbows . In addition , the strong towers may have served as platforms for trebuchets for shooting back at the besiegers . The walls typically include towers , arrow slits , and wall - head defenses such as crenellation and , in more advanced cases , machicolations , all aimed at an active style of defence . The Krak des Chevaliers in Syria is the best preserved of the concentric crusader castles . By contrast , Château Pèlerin was not a concentric castle , as the side facing the sea did not require defensive walls . However , the two walls facing the land are built on the same defensive principles as other crusader castles in the same period , rivalling the defences at Krak .

Memorizing flashcards is an example of rote learning . Coming up with your own examples of concepts is an example of meaningful learning . Relating what you learned to something in your own life not only makes the topic more interesting , encouraging further research and learning , but it also makes it easier to remember . Meaningful learning encourages the learner to understand the information presented and will help them to come up with active learning techniques to aid their understanding .

The conflict began following Pakistan 's Operation Gibraltar , which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule . India retaliated by launching a full - scale military attack on West Pakistan . The seventeen - day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II . Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations - mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States , and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration . Much of the war was fought by the countries ' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan . This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of British India in 1947 , a number that was overshadowed only during the 2001 -- 2002 military standoff between India and Pakistan . Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units , with substantial backing from air forces , and naval operations . The war exposed Pakistan 's inadequate standards of military training , its misguided selection of officers , poor command and control arrangements , poor intelligence gathering and bad intelligence procedures .

The volcanoes could also have emitted enough H O to cover the whole Martian surface to a depth of 120 m ( 390 ft ) . CO is a greenhouse gas that raises the temperature of a planet : it traps heat by absorbing infrared radiation .

{"q_id": -1858780041068412425, "question": "in regards to adolescence what is the personal fable and the imaginary audience", "answer": " Feelings of uniqueness may stem from fascination with one 's own thoughts to the point where an adolescent believes that his thoughts or experiences are completely novel and unique when compared to the thoughts or experiences of others . This belief stems from the adolescent 's inability to differentiate between the concern ( s ) of his thoughts from the thoughts of others , while simultaneously over-differentiating his feelings . Thus , an adolescent is likely to think that everyone else ( the imaginary audience ) is just as concerned with him as he himself is ; while at the same time , this adolescent might believe that he is the only person who can possibly experience whatever feelings he might be experiencing at that particular time and that these experiences are unique to him . According to David Elkind ( 1967 ) , an adolescent 's intense focus on himself or herself as the center of attention is what ultimately gives rise to the belief that one is completely unique , and in turn , this may give rise to feelings of invulnerability . Ultimately , the two marked characteristics of personal fable are feelings of uniqueness and invulnerability . Or as David Elkind states , `` this complex of beliefs in the uniqueness of ( the adolescent 's ) feelings and of his immortality might be called a `` personal fable '' , a story which he tells himself and which is not true .

The Assembly asked Herbert Palmer to produce a draft of the Larger Catechism . Robert Baillie and other Scottish delegates found the work disappointing . In December 1643 a committee was formed to write the Catechism . In January 1647 the Assembly gave up writing one catechism and split it into two . The Westminster Shorter Catechism was to be `` easier to read and concise for beginners '' and the Larger Catechism was to be `` more exact and comprehensive '' . The Catechism was completed by the Westminster Assembly in 1647 . It was then adopted by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1648 and ( with modifications relating to the civil magistrate ) by the Presbyterian Synod of New York and Philadelphia in 1788 , and by the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. , upon its formation the following year .

One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the majority or governing party while the other is the minority or opposition party . Around the world , the term has different senses . For example , in the United States , Jamaica , and Malta , the sense of two party system describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties , and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature . In such arrangements , two - party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner takes all election rules . In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest .

The Germans attacked a weakly defended section of the Allied line , taking advantage of heavily overcast weather conditions that grounded the Allies ' overwhelmingly superior air forces . Fierce resistance on the northern shoulder of the offensive , around Elsenborn Ridge , and in the south , around Bastogne , blocked German access to key roads to the northwest and west that they counted on for success . Columns of armor and infantry that were supposed to advance along parallel routes found themselves on the same roads . This , and terrain that favored the defenders , threw the German advance behind schedule and allowed the Allies to reinforce the thinly placed troops .

{"q_id": -4780324468709690098, "question": "what is the science behind mentos and diet coke", "answer": " The conversion of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda , which pushes the beverage contents out of the container . Gasses , in general , are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures . Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure . The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened , and the pressure is released . Under these conditions , carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution , forming gas bubbles . Normally , this process is relatively slow , because the activation energy for this process is high . The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms . It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself ( homogeneous nucleation ) , and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface ( heterogeneous nucleation ) . When the pressure is released from a soda bottle , the bubbles tend to form on the sides of the bottle . But because they are smooth and clean , the activation energy is still relatively high , and the process is slow . The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy , much like a catalyst . For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy , and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation . The physical characteristics of Mentos ( surface roughness , easy dissolution into the liquid , etc . ) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation , so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high . The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol . This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water , which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules , causes the water to foam , ultimately generating the `` jet '' -- or `` geyser '' -- or eruption - like nature of the effusion . The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke , and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy , all which influence the nature of water 's surface tension and degree to which it can foam .

Many tribes used Arkansas as their hunting lands but the main tribe was the Quapaw who settled in Arkansas River delta upon moving south from Illinois . Early French explorers gave the territory its name , a corruption of Akansea , which is a phonetic spelling of the Illinois word for the Quapaw . This phonetic heritage explains why `` Arkansas '' is pronounced so differently than `` Kansas '' even though they share the same spelling . What began as a rough wilderness inhabited by trappers and hunters became incorporated into the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and became Arkansas Territory in 1819 . Upon gaining statehood in 1836 , Arkansas had begun to prosper under a plantation economy that was heavily reliant on slave labor . After the Civil War Arkansas was a poor rural state based on cotton . Prosperity returned in the 1940s . The state became famous for its political leadership , including President Bill Clinton ( Governor , 1979 − 81 and 1983 − 92 ) , and as the base for the Walmart corporation .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays .

It is an allosteric enzyme made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors . PFK - 1 catalyzes the important `` committed '' step of glycolysis , the conversion of fructose 6 - phosphate and ATP to fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP . Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration , both anaerobic and aerobic . Because phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) catalyzes the ATP - dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose - 6 - phosphate into fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP , it is one of the key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis . PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition , and in this way , the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell 's energy requirements . For example , a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis . The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate . The purpose of fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate is to supersede ATP inhibition , thus allowing eukaryotes to have greater sensitivity to regulation by hormones like glucagon and insulin .

It consists of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins . The basic function of the cell membrane is to protect the cell from its surroundings . The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of cells and organelles . In this way , it is selectively permeable to ions and organic molecules . In addition , cell membranes are involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell adhesion , ion conductivity and cell signalling and serve as the attachment surface for several extracellular structures , including the cell wall , the carbohydrate layer called the glycocalyx , and the intracellular network of protein fibers called the cytoskeleton .

An example is a small object floating in water , which does not appear to have weight since it is buoyed by the water ; but it is found to have its usual weight when it is added to water in a container which is entirely supported by and weighed on a scale . Thus , the `` weightless object '' floating in water actually transfers its weight to the bottom of the container ( where the pressure increases ) . Similarly , a balloon has mass but may appear to have no weight or even negative weight , due to buoyancy in air . However the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it has merely been transferred to a large area of the Earth 's surface , making the weight difficult to measure .

Another advantage of administering a drug rectally , is that it tends to produce less nausea compared to the oral route and prevents any amount of the drug from being lost due to emesis ( vomiting ) . In addition , the rectal route bypasses around two thirds of the first - pass metabolism as the rectum 's venous drainage is two thirds systemic ( middle and inferior rectal vein ) and one third hepatic portal system ( superior rectal vein ) . This means the drug will reach the circulatory system with significantly less alteration and in greater concentrations . Finally , rectal administration can allow patients to remain in the home setting when the oral route is compromised . Unlike intravenous lines , which usually need to be placed in an inpatient environment and require special formulation of sterile medications , a specialized rectal catheter can be placed by a clinician , such as a hospice nurse or home health nurse , in the home .

Because the field is reset after each tackle in American football , it is much slower - paced than the more hectic rugby league , in which play stops for only as long as it takes the tackled player to get back to his feet and return the ball to play . Another major difference is that only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with in rugby league ; defending players interfering with any other attacking player ( and vice versa ) will incur a penalty . Passing in the two sports also differs : while backward passing is common to both sports , in American football players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations whereas in rugby league forward passing is always illegal . Rugby league players have to kick the ball or run it forward to advance it downfield . To score a try or touchdown in rugby league , the player has to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone , whereas in American football the player has to simply cross the line . American football also requires its players to use a large amount of protective equipment , including helmets , gloves and padding around the body , whereas protective clothing is much more minimal in rugby league , usually amounting to light padding ( if any ) and soft head gear ( hard helmets being illegal ) .

{"q_id": -6413137982283293434, "question": "why was salt considered as valuable as gold in ancient mali", "answer": " The next great unit of exchange in the Mali Empire was salt . Salt was as valuable , if not more valuable , than gold in sub-Saharan Africa . It was cut into pieces and spent on goods with close to equal buying power throughout the empire . While it was as good as gold in the north , it was even better in the south . The people of the south needed salt for their diet , but it was extremely rare . The northern region on the other hand had no shortage of salt . Every year merchants entered Mali via Oualata with camel loads of salt to sell in Niani . According to Ibn Battuta who visited Mali in the mid-14th century , one camel load of salt sold at Walata for 8 -- 10 mithqals of gold , but in Mali proper it realised 20 -- 30 ducats and sometimes even 40 . One particular source of salt in the Mali Empire was salt - mining sites located in Taghaza . Ibn Battuta had written that in Taghaza there were no trees and there is only sand and the salt mines . Nobody lived in the area except the Musafa servants who worked to dig the salts and lived on dates imported from Sijilmasa and the Dar'a valley , camel meat and millet imported from the Sudan . The buildings were constructed from slabs of salt and roofed with camel skins . The salt was dug from the ground and cut into thick slabs , two of which were loaded onto each camel where they would be taken south across the desert to Oualata and sold . The value of the salt was chiefly determined by the transport costs . Ibn Battuta mentions that the value of salt increased fourfold when transported between Oualata and the Malian capital .

{"q_id": 4510469085574648633, "question": "what happens when you mix coca cola and mentos", "answer": " The conversion of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda , which pushes the beverage contents out of the container . Gasses , in general , are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures . Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure . The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened , and the pressure is released . Under these conditions , carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution , forming gas bubbles . Normally , this process is relatively slow , because the activation energy for this process is high . The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms . It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself ( homogeneous nucleation ) , and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface ( heterogeneous nucleation ) . When the pressure is released from a soda bottle , the bubbles tend to form on the sides of the bottle . But because they are smooth and clean , the activation energy is still relatively high , and the process is slow . The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy , much like a catalyst . For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy , and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation . The physical characteristics of Mentos ( surface roughness , easy dissolution into the liquid , etc . ) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation , so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high . The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol . This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water , which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules , causes the water to foam , ultimately generating the `` jet '' -- or `` geyser '' -- or eruption - like nature of the effusion . The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke , and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy , all which influence the nature of water 's surface tension and degree to which it can foam .

{"q_id": 4262033417188171788, "question": "how does overall sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system control effect blood pressure", "answer": " Messages travel through the sympathetic nervous system in a bi-directional flow . Efferent messages can trigger changes in different parts of the body simultaneously . For example , the sympathetic nervous system can accelerate heart rate ; widen bronchial passages ; decrease motility ( movement ) of the large intestine ; constrict blood vessels ; increase peristalsis in the oesophagus ; cause pupillary dilation , piloerection ( goose bumps ) and perspiration ( sweating ) ; and raise blood pressure . One exception is with certain blood vessels such as those in the cerebral and coronary arteries , which dilate ( rather than constrict ) with an increase in sympathetic tone . This is because of a proportional increase in the presence of β adrenergic receptors rather than α receptors . β receptors promote vessel dilation instead of constriction like α1 receptors . An alternative explanation is that the primary ( and direct ) effect of sympathetic stimulation on coronary arteries is vasoconstriction followed by a secondary vasodilation caused by the release of vasodilatory metabolites due to the sympathetically increased cardiac inotropy and heart rate . This secondary vasodilation caused by the primary vasoconstriction is termed functional sympatholysis , the overall effect of which on coronary arteries is dilation .

{"q_id": -8641774408659474363, "question": "what is eddy current loss in a transformer", "answer": " By Lenz 's law , an eddy current creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that created it , and thus eddy currents react back on the source of the magnetic field . For example , a nearby conductive surface will exert a drag force on a moving magnet that opposes its motion , due to eddy currents induced in the surface by the moving magnetic field . This effect is employed in eddy current brakes which are used to stop rotating power tools quickly when they are turned off . The current flowing through the resistance of the conductor also dissipates energy as heat in the material . Thus eddy currents are a cause of energy loss in alternating current ( AC ) inductors , transformers , electric motors and generators , and other AC machinery , requiring special construction such as laminated magnetic cores or ferrite cores to minimize them . Eddy currents are also used to heat objects in induction heating furnaces and equipment , and to detect cracks and flaws in metal parts using eddy - current testing instruments .

One economic impact of the baby boom is the concern that when baby boomers get older and retire , the dependency ratio will increase . The Census Bureau estimates that the dependency ratio in the United States will be 65 by 2020 and reach a record - breaking high of 75 , the highest it has been since the 1960s and 1970s when those baby boomers were children . The economics of an area or country could benefit from the baby boom : It could increase the demand of housing , transportation , facilities and more for the increasing population . With an increase in population , the demand for food also increased .

{"q_id": 6381689168791204470, "question": "what is the role of fad in metabolism", "answer": " FAD has a more positive reduction potential than NAD+ and is a very strong oxidizing agent . The cell utilizes this in many energetically difficult oxidation reactions such as dehydrogenation of a C-C bond to an alkene . FAD - dependent proteins function in a large variety of metabolic pathways including electron transport , DNA repair , nucleotide biosynthesis , beta - oxidation of fatty acids , amino acid catabolism , as well as synthesis of other cofactors such as CoA , CoQ and heme groups . One well - known reaction is part of the citric acid cycle ( also known as the TCA or Krebs cycle ) ; succinate dehydrogenase ( complex II in the electron transport chain ) requires covalently bound FAD to catalyze the oxidation of succinate to fumarate by coupling it with the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol . The high - energy electrons from this oxidation are stored momentarily by reducing FAD to FADH . FADH then reverts to FAD , sending its two high - energy electrons through the electron transport chain ; the energy in FADH is enough to produce 1.5 equivalents of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation . There are also redox flavoproteins that non-covalently bind to FAD like Acetyl - CoA - dehydrogenases which are involved in beta - oxidation of fatty acids and catabolism of amino acids like leucine ( isovaleryl - CoA dehydrogenase ) , isoleucine , ( short / branched - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase ) , valine ( isobutyryl - CoA dehydrogenase ) , and lysine ( glutaryl - CoA dehydrogenase ) . Additional examples of FAD - dependent enzymes that regulate metabolism are glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( triglyceride synthesis ) and xanthine oxidase involved in purine nucleotide catabolism . There are other noncatalytic roles that FAD can play in flavoproteins such as structural roles , or involved in blue - sensitive light photoreceptors that regulate biological clocks and development , generation of light in bioluminescent bacteria .

Sweeping a rock makes it curl less , and decreases the friction that slows the rock down . A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation , and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result .

Moreover , Neo-Confucianist thought derived from the works of Cheng Yi , Cheng Hao , and Zhu Xi , and the then - orthodox ideology of China and Korea . The rise of Neo-Confucianism in Japan was aided by state support from the Tokugawa government , who encouraged the establishment of national secular ideology as a method of strengthening political rule over the country .

This method uses highly polymorphic regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA ( the most common is 4 bases repeated , but there are other lengths in use , including 3 and 5 bases ) . Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units , STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals .

{"q_id": 1646664004219800853, "question": "how does surfactant reduce surface tension in the lungs", "answer": " Compliance is the ability of lungs and thorax to expand . Lung compliance is defined as the volume change per unit of pressure change across the lung . Measurements of lung volume obtained during the controlled inflation / deflation of a normal lung show that the volumes obtained during deflation exceed those during inflation , at a given pressure . This difference in inflation and deflation volumes at a given pressure is called hysteresis and is due to the air - water surface tension that occurs at the beginning of inflation . However , surfactant decreases the alveolar surface tension , as seen in cases of premature infants suffering from infant respiratory distress syndrome . The normal surface tension for water is 70 dyn / cm ( 70 mN / m ) and in the lungs it is 25 dyn / cm ( 25 mN / m ) ; however , at the end of the expiration , compressed surfactant phospholipid molecules decrease the surface tension to very low , near - zero levels . Pulmonary surfactant thus greatly reduces surface tension , increasing compliance allowing the lung to inflate much more easily , thereby reducing the work of breathing . It reduces the pressure difference needed to allow the lung to inflate . The lung 's compliance decreases and ventilation decreases when lung tissue becomes diseased and fibrotic .

One hypothesis speculates that by increasing production per unit of land area , agriculture will not need to expand into new , uncultivated areas to feed a growing human population . However , land degradation and soil nutrients depletion have forced farmers to clear up formerly forested areas in order to keep up with production . A counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity , and because the Green Revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid . For example , the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content , permitted the introduction of agriculture in sensitive Brazilian ecosystems such as Cerrado semi-humid tropical savanna and Amazon rainforest in the geoeconomic macroregions of Centro - Sul and Amazônia .

It is an allosteric enzyme made of 4 subunits and controlled by many activators and inhibitors . PFK - 1 catalyzes the important `` committed '' step of glycolysis , the conversion of fructose 6 - phosphate and ATP to fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP . Glycolysis is the foundation for respiration , both anaerobic and aerobic . Because phosphofructokinase ( PFK ) catalyzes the ATP - dependent phosphorylation to convert fructose - 6 - phosphate into fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate and ADP , it is one of the key regulatory and rate limiting steps of glycolysis . PFK is able to regulate glycolysis through allosteric inhibition , and in this way , the cell can increase or decrease the rate of glycolysis in response to the cell 's energy requirements . For example , a high ratio of ATP to ADP will inhibit PFK and glycolysis . The key difference between the regulation of PFK in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is that in eukaryotes PFK is activated by fructose 2 , 6 - bisphosphate .

Splice site consensus sequences that drive exon recognition are located at the very termini of introns . The deletion of the splicing site results in one or more introns remaining in mature mRNA and may lead to the production of abnormal proteins . When a splice site mutation occurs , the mRNA transcript possesses information from these introns that normally should not be included . Introns are supposed to be removed , while the exons are expressed . The mutation must occur at the specific site at which intron splicing occurs : within non-coding sites in a gene , directly next to the location of the exon . The mutation can be an insertion , deletion , frame shift , etc . The splicing process itself is controlled by the given sequences , known as splice - donor and splice - acceptor sequences , which surround each exon . Mutations in these sequences may lead to retention of large segments of intronic DNA by the mRNA , or to entire exons being spliced out of the mRNA . These changes could result in production of a nonfunctional protein . An intron is separated from its exon by means of the splice site . Acceptor - site and donor - site relating to the splice sites signal to the splicesome where the actual cut should be made . These donor sites , or recognition sites , are essential in the processing of mRNA .

{"q_id": 6232851014974065309, "question": "how can inclusive fitness lead to kin selection", "answer": " Kin selection causes changes in gene frequency across generations , driven by interactions between related individuals . This dynamic forms the conceptual basis of the theory of social evolution . Some cases of evolution by natural selection can only be understood by considering how biological relatives influence each other 's fitness . Under natural selection , a gene encoding a trait that enhances the fitness of each individual carrying it should increase in frequency within the population ; and conversely , a gene that lowers the individual fitness of its carriers should be eliminated . However , a hypothetical gene that prompts behaviour which enhances the fitness of relatives but lowers that of the individual displaying the behaviour , may nonetheless increase in frequency , because relatives often carry the same gene . According to this principle , the enhanced fitness of relatives can at times more than compensate for the fitness loss incurred by the individuals displaying the behaviour , making kin selection possible . This is a special case of a more general model , `` inclusive fitness '' . This analysis has been challenged , Wilson writing that `` the foundations of the general theory of inclusive fitness based on the theory of kin selection have crumbled '' and that he now relies instead on the theory of eusociality and `` gene - culture co-evolution '' for the underlying mechanics of sociobiology .

The concept , published by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation of papers in 1858 , was elaborated in Darwin 's influential 1859 book On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection , or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life . He described natural selection as analogous to artificial selection , a process by which animals and plants with traits considered desirable by human breeders are systematically favoured for reproduction . The concept of natural selection originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity ; at the time of Darwin 's writing , science had yet to develop modern theories of genetics . The union of traditional Darwinian evolution with subsequent discoveries in classical genetics formed the modern synthesis of the mid-20th century .

{"q_id": 5724779764737190116, "question": "what is the purpose of drying at a constant weight", "answer": " In some products having a relatively high initial moisture content , an initial linear reduction of the average product moisture content as a function of time may be observed for a limited time , often known as a `` constant drying rate period '' . Usually , in this period , it is surface moisture outside individual particles that is being removed . The drying rate during this period is mostly dependent on the rate of heat transfer to the material being dried . Therefore , the maximum achievable drying rate is considered to be heat - transfer limited . If drying is continued , the slope of the curve , the drying rate , becomes less steep ( falling rate period ) and eventually tends to nearly horizontal at very long times . The product moisture content is then constant at the `` equilibrium moisture content '' , where it is , in practice , in equilibrium with the dehydrating medium . In the falling - rate period , water migration from the product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion , i , e. the water flux is proportional to the moisture content gradient . This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values , a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics . If water removal is considerable , the products usually undergo shrinkage and deformation , except in a well - designed freeze - drying process . The drying rate in the falling - rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being `` mass - transfer limited '' . This is widely noticed in hygroscopic products such as fruits and vegetables , where drying occurs in the falling rate period with the constant drying rate period said to be negligible .

When DNA synthesis is impaired , the cell cycle can not progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis ( M ) stage . This leads to continuing cell growth without division , which presents as macrocytosis . Megaloblastic anemia has a rather slow onset , especially when compared to that of other anemias . The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to hypovitaminosis , specifically a deficiency of vitamin B and / or folic acid . Vitamin B deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate , as the mechanism is loss of B dependent folate recycling , followed by folate - deficiency loss of nucleic acid synthesis ( specifically thymine ) , leading to defects in DNA synthesis . Folic acid supplementation in the absence of vitamin B prevents this type of anemia ( although other vitamin B - specific pathologies may be present ) . Loss of micronutrients may also be a cause .

It was held from Friday , October 31 to Wednesday , December 3 , 1800 . In what is sometimes referred to as the `` Revolution of 1800 '' , Vice President Thomas Jefferson defeated President John Adams . The election was a realigning election that ushered in a generation of Democratic - Republican Party rule and the eventual demise of the Federalist Party in the First Party System . It was a long , bitter re-match of the 1796 election between the pro-French and pro-decentralization Democratic - Republicans under Jefferson and Aaron Burr and the incumbent Adams and Charles Pinckney 's pro-British and pro-centralization Federalists . The chief political issues revolved around the fallout from the French Revolution , including opposition to the tax imposed by Congress to pay for the mobilization of the new army and the navy in the Quasi-War against France in 1798 .

{"q_id": 8562580350146016500, "question": "what is the difference between the genitor and the pater", "answer": " As social and biological concepts of parenthood are not necessarily coterminous , the terms `` pater '' and `` genitor '' have been used in anthropology to distinguish between the man who is socially recognised as father ( pater ) and the man who is believed to be the physiological parent ( genitor ) ; similarly the terms `` mater '' and `` genitrix '' have been used to distinguish between the woman socially recognised as mother ( mater ) and the woman believed to be the physiological parent ( genitrix ) . Such a distinction is useful when the individual who is considered the legal parent of the child is not the individual who is believed to be the child 's biological parent . For example , in his ethnography of the Nuer , Evans - Pritchard notes that if a widow , following the death of her husband , chooses to live with a lover outside of her deceased husband 's kin group , that lover is only considered genitor of any subsequent children the widow has , and her deceased husband continues to be considered the pater . As a result , the lover has no legal control over the children , who may be taken away from him by the kin of the pater when they choose . The terms `` pater '' and `` genitor '' have also been used to help describe the relationship between children and their parents in the context of divorce in Britain . Following the divorce and remarriage of their parents , children find themselves using the term `` mother '' or `` father '' in relation to more than one individual , and the pater or mater who is legally responsible for the child 's care , and whose family name the child uses , may not be the genitor or genitrix of the child , with whom a separate parent - child relationship may be maintained through arrangements such as visitation rights or joint custody .

Project managers must understand several basic principles of cost management to be effective in managing project cost . Important concepts include profits and profit margins , life cycle costing , cash flow analysis , sunk cost , and learning curve theory . Planning cost management involves determining the policies , procedures , and documentation that will be used for planning , executing , and controlling project cost . The main output of this process is a cost management plan . Estimating costs is a very important part of project cost management . There are several types of cost estimates , including rough order of magnitude ( ROM ) , budgetary , and definitive . Each type of estimate is done during different stages of the project life cycle , and each has a different level of accuracy . Several tool and techniques can help you develop cost estimates , including analogous estimating , bottom - up estimating , parametric estimating , and computerized tools . Determining the budget involves allocating costs to individual work items over time . It is important to understand how particular organizations prepare budgets so estimates are made accordingly . Controlling cost includes monitoring cost performance , reviewing changes , and notifying project stakeholders of changes related to cost . Many basic accounting and finance principles relate to cost project management . Earned value management is an important method used for measuring project performance . Earned value management integrates scope , cost , and schedule information .

The people watch shadows projected on the wall from objects passing in front of a fire behind them , and give names to these shadows . The shadows are the prisoners ' reality . Socrates explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not reality at all , for he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the manufactured reality that is the shadows seen by the prisoners . The inmates of this place do not even desire to leave their prison , for they know no better life . The prisoners manage to break their bonds one day , and discover that their reality was not what they thought it was . They discovered the sun , which Plato uses as an analogy for the fire that man can not see behind . Like the fire that cast light on the walls of the cave , the human condition is forever bound to the impressions that are received through the senses . Even if these interpretations ( or , in Kantian terminology , intuitions ) are an absurd misrepresentation of reality , we can not somehow break free from the bonds of our human condition -- we can not free ourselves from phenomenal state just as the prisoners could not free themselves from their chains . If , however , we were to miraculously escape our bondage , we would find a world that we could not understand -- the sun is incomprehensible for someone who has never seen it .

Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection ; that is , the slow creeping motion of Earth 's solid mantle . Plate movement is thought to be driven by a combination of the motion of the seafloor away from spreading ridges due to variations in topography ( the ridge is a topographic high ) and density changes in the crust ( density increases as newly formed crust cools and moves away from the ridge ) . At subduction zones the relatively cold , dense crust is `` pulled '' or sinks down into the mantle over the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell .

If the absurd experience is truly the realization that the universe is fundamentally devoid of absolutes , then we as individuals are truly free . `` To live without appeal , '' as he puts it , is a philosophical move to define absolutes and universals subjectively , rather than objectively . The freedom of humans is thus established in a human 's natural ability and opportunity to create their own meaning and purpose ; to decide ( or think ) for him - or herself . The individual becomes the most precious unit of existence , representing a set of unique ideals that can be characterized as an entire universe in its own right .

The U.S. involvement in South Vietnam stemmed from 20 long years of political and economic action . These had the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam . At the time , French forces , allies of the U.S. , were backed by America -- President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing amounts of financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam . From the spring of 1950 , their involvement increased from just assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states ( Vietnam , Laos , Cambodia ) . Eventually , U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending out increasing number of military assistance from the United States . Their main intent was to restrict the Communist domination that was present in the government of Vietnam as it would soon lead to a chain of neighbouring countries adopting the same . This would have resulted in a change in balance of power throughout Southeast Asia .

It is therefore recommended to palpate and auscultate when manually recording a patient 's blood pressure . Typically the blood pressure obtained via palpation is around 10 mmHg lower than the pressure obtained via auscultation . In general , the examiner can avoid being confused by an auscultatory gap by always inflating a blood pressure cuff to 20 - 40 mmHg higher than the pressure required to occlude the brachial pulse .

It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union , but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the $50 half union exist . However , only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar ; `` dime '' is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10 ¢ , while `` eagle '' and `` mill '' are largely unknown to the general public , though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies , and gasoline prices are usually in the form of $ X. XX9 per gallon , e.g. , $3.599 , more commonly written as $3.59 ​ ⁄ . When currently issued in circulating form , denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes ( with the exception of gold , silver and platinum coins valued up to $100 as legal tender , but worth far more as bullion ) . Both one - dollar coins and notes are produced today , although the note form is significantly more common . In the past , `` paper money '' was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar ( fractional currency ) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of $20 ( known as the `` double eagle '' , discontinued in the 1930s ) . The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars , and subsequently was used in naming gold coins . Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination , known as `` fractional currency '' , was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as `` shinplasters '' . In 1854 , James Guthrie , then Secretary of the Treasury , proposed creating $100 , $50 and $25 gold coins , which were referred to as a `` Union '' , `` Half Union '' , and `` Quarter Union '' , thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = $100 .

{"q_id": -8134699029903922331, "question": "what is a hard cost vs soft cost", "answer": " For a contractor , soft costs are essentially construction costs incurred that are not labor and materials . Delay in Start Up insurance coverage and soft costs are not the same . Some soft costs may be incurred in the repair of a covered loss before the anticipated completion date is reached . These can be architect fees or engineering fees incurred to repair loss or damage to the insured property . Only those indirect costs that are above what would have been incurred up to the anticipated completion date but continue after such date due to the insured delay are soft costs that are covered by delay in completion or delay in start up coverage . Soft cost is a contractor accounting term for their expenses that are not associated with a particular construction task . Their construction trailer , water delivery , book keepers , etc. are all soft costs that continue on after the original anticipated completion date is reached , if the project is delayed . Only if the delay was caused by an insured loss would the insurance pick these expenses up , and only if the policy includes delay in start up coverage . Any repair costs which are not labor or materials and are indemnified to complete the repair of property loss should not be reported under delay in completion and there is no delay in completion until the anticipated date of completion is reached , and the project is not finished . Not all indirect costs are time related expenses that continue after the original date of completion . Those soft costs ( indirect costs ) which are continuing fixed expenses that continue because the project is delayed by an insured loss are soft costs that should be included with the delay in start up values . A soft cost to a contractor , such as his administration costs , can be a hard cost to the owner because what the contractor invoices the owner is the owner 's direct cost . If the owner employs engineers to overlook construction as the project is executed , this will be a continuing expense during repair if the repair is done after the original completion date and would be reported in the delay in completion values . If the engineer cost was a one time charge for a design , he may need to be consulted in order for the loss to be repaired . This expense does not occur because of a delay , but is incurred to repair property damage and hence should be included in the construction costs if the intention is for that expense to be covered in the indemnification depending on policy wording . If the project is insured to the extent of the reported values , and that value was left out to compute the premium , the company may decline that cost in the indemnification .

It was proposed by Ernst Munch , a German plant physiologist in 1930 . A high concentration of organic substances , particularly sugar , inside cells of the phloem at a source , such as a leaf , creates a diffusion gradient ( osmotic gradient ) that draws water into the cells from the adjacent xylem . This creates turgor pressure , also known as hydrostatic pressure , in the phloem . Movement of phloem sap occurs by bulk flow ( mass flow ) from sugar sources to sugar sinks . The movement in phloem is bidirectional , whereas , in xylem cells , it is unidirectional ( upward ) .

As an example , suppose the price of a television is $600 , the quantity supplied at that price is 1000 televisions , and the quantity demanded is 300 televisions . This illustrates that sellers are seeking to sell 700 more televisions than buyers are willing to purchase . Hence , an excess supply of 700 televisions exists , indicating that the market is in a state of disequilibrium . In this situation , producers would not be able to sell all the televisions they produce at the desired price of $600 . This will induce them to reduce their price in order to make the product more attractive for the buyers . In response to the reduction in the price of the product , consumers will increase their quantity demanded and producers will not produce as many as before . The market will eventually become balanced as the market is transitioning to an equilibrium price and quantity . ", "wiki_title": "Excess supply", "split": "train"}

I , 2 ) . In Locke 's philosophy , tabula rasa was the theory that at birth the ( human ) mind is a `` blank slate '' without rules for processing data , and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one 's sensory experiences . The notion is central to Lockean empiricism . As understood by Locke , tabula rasa meant that the mind of the individual was born blank , and it also emphasized the freedom of individuals to author their own soul . Individuals are free to define the content of their character -- but basic identity as a member of the human species can not be altered . This presumption of a free , self - authored mind combined with an immutable human nature leads to the Lockean doctrine of `` natural '' rights . Locke 's idea of tabula rasa is frequently compared with Thomas Hobbes 's viewpoint of human nature , in which humans are endowed with inherent mental content -- particularly with selfishness .

This means that most men ( about 68 % , assuming a normal distribution ) have a height within 3 inches ( 7.62 cm ) of the mean ( 67 -- 73 inches ( 170.18 -- 185.42 cm ) ) -- one standard deviation -- and almost all men ( about 95 % ) have a height within 6 inches ( 15.24 cm ) of the mean ( 64 -- 76 inches ( 162.56 -- 193.04 cm ) ) -- two standard deviations . If the standard deviation were zero , then all men would be exactly 70 inches ( 177.8 cm ) tall .

During this phase , the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis . Interphase is the ' daily living ' or metabolic phase of the cell , in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them , grows , reads its DNA , and conducts other `` normal '' cell functions . The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase . This phase was formerly called the resting phase . However , interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting ; rather , the cell is living , and preparing for later cell division , so the name was changed . A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis . However , since mitosis is the division of the nucleus , prophase is actually the first stage .

If any sexual contact was made by the adult to the minor , then child molestation has occurred . Other serious offenses are sexual assault , statutory rape , bestiality , child sexual abuse , female genital mutilation , incest , rape , and sexual imposition .

They are more common in the animal kingdom . Osmoregulators actively control salt concentrations despite the salt concentrations in the environment . An example is freshwater fish . The gills actively uptake salt from the environment by the use of mitochondria - rich cells . Water will diffuse into the fish , so it excretes a very hypotonic ( dilute ) urine to expel all the excess water . A marine fish has an internal osmotic concentration lower than that of the surrounding seawater , so it tends to lose water and gain salt . It actively excretes salt out from the gills . Most fish are stenohaline , which means they are restricted to either salt or fresh water and can not survive in water with a different salt concentration than they are adapted to . However , some fish show a tremendous ability to effectively osmoregulate across a broad range of salinities ; fish with this ability are known as euryhaline species , e.g. , Flounder .

The Republic is a dramatic dialogue , not a treatise . Socrates ' definition of justice is never unconditionally stated , only versions of justice within each city are `` found '' and evaluated in Books II through Book V. Socrates constantly refers the definition of justice back to the conditions of the city for which it is created . He builds a series of myths , or noble lies , to make the cities appear just , and these conditions moderate life within the communities . The `` earth born '' myth makes all men believe that they are born from the earth and have predestined natures within their veins . Accordingly , Socrates defines justice as `` working at that which he is naturally best suited '' , and `` to do one 's own business and not to be a busybody '' ( 433a -- 433b ) and goes on to say that justice sustains and perfects the other three cardinal virtues : Temperance , Wisdom , and Courage , and that justice is the cause and condition of their existence . Socrates does not include justice as a virtue within the city , suggesting that justice does not exist within the human soul either , rather it is the result of a `` well ordered '' soul . A result of this conception of justice separates people into three types ; that of the soldier , that of the producer , and that of a ruler .

Unlike a direct free kick , a goal may not be scored directly from the kick ; the ball must first come into contact with another player ( from either team ) .

This law was absorbed into the Laws of the Game in 1877 and later adapted to allow indirect free kicks as a result of dangerous play . An indirect free kick is awarded to the opposing team when a player infringes certain technical requirements of the laws ( e.g. touching the ball a second time following a restart , or the keeper touching the ball with his hands when a teammate has used his foot to pass it back to the keeper ) .

A contrast medium , usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water , is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract , and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest . The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film . This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx , larynx , esophagus , stomach , and small intestine such that the inside wall lining , size , shape , contour , and patency are visible to the examiner . With fluoroscopy , it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing , peristalsis , or sphincter closure . Depending on the organs to be examined , barium radiographs can be classified into barium swallow , barium meal , barium follow - through , and enteroclysis ( small bowel enema ) . To further enhance the quality of images , air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium , and this procedure is called double - contrast imaging .

Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ; the saliva also contains mucus , which lubricates the food , and hydrogen carbonate , which provides the ideal conditions of pH ( alkaline ) for amylase to work . After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus . It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis . Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion . Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin . As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall , mucus is secreted by the stomach , providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals . At the same time protein digestion is occurring , mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall .

One of the purposes of nasal mucus is to warm inhaled air to body temperature as it enters the body . In order for this to happen , the nasal cavities must be constantly coated with liquid mucus . During cold , dry seasons , the mucus lining nasal passages tends to dry out , meaning that mucous membranes must work harder , producing more mucus to keep the cavity lined . As a result , the nasal cavity can fill up with mucus . At the same time , when air is exhaled , water vapor in breath condenses as the warm air meets the colder outside temperature near the nostrils . This causes an excess amount of water to build up inside nasal cavities . In these cases , the excess fluid usually spills out externally through the nostrils .

Before the 14th century , the heart shape was not associated with the meaning of the heart metaphor . The geometric shape itself is found in much earlier sources , but in such instances does not depict a heart , but typically foliage : in examples from antiquity fig leaves , and in medieval iconography and heraldry typically the leaves of ivy and of the water - lily . One possible early use in the 11th century could be found in the manuscript , Al - Maqamat written by Al Hariri of Basra .

His breakthrough was using a `` belt '' press , which was capable of producing pressures above 10 GPa ( 1,500,000 psi ) and temperatures above 2,000 ° C ( 3,630 ° F ) . The press used a pyrophyllite container in which graphite was dissolved within molten nickel , cobalt or iron . Those metals acted as a `` solvent - catalyst '' , which both dissolved carbon and accelerated its conversion into diamond . The largest diamond he produced was 0.15 mm ( 0.0059 in ) across ; it was too small and visually imperfect for jewelry , but usable in industrial abrasives . Hall 's co-workers were able to replicate his work , and the discovery was published in the major journal Nature . He was the first person to grow a synthetic diamond with a reproducible , verifiable and well - documented process . He left GE in 1955 , and three years later developed a new apparatus for the synthesis of diamond -- a tetrahedral press with four anvils -- to avoid violating a U.S. Department of Commerce secrecy order on the GE patent applications .

Hence , all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities , melting and boiling points , as well as heats of sublimation , vaporisation , and dissociation . They all crystallise in the body - centered cubic crystal structure , and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited . The ns configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii , as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity . Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s - orbital to form the + 1 oxidation state , due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy . Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group . The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity ; thus , the presentation of its properties here is limited . What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium , as expected .

( Previous English defamation law had not provided this guarantee . ) Though the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was designed to protect freedom of the press , for most of the history of the United States , the U.S. Supreme Court failed to use it to rule on libel cases . This left libel laws , based upon the traditional `` Common Law '' of defamation inherited from the English legal system , mixed across the states . The 1964 case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , however , radically changed the nature of libel law in the United States by establishing that public officials could win a suit for libel only when they could prove the media outlet in question knew either that the information was wholly and patently false or that it was published `` with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not '' .

However , this is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system , and reflects the coordinate freedom ( diffeomorphism invariance ) of general relativity .

PEMFCs operate at a lower temperature , are lighter and more compact , which makes them ideal for applications such as cars . However , some disadvantages are : the ~ 80 ° C operating temperature is too low for cogeneration like in SOFCs , and that the electrolyte for PEMFCs must be water - saturated . However , some fuel - cell cars , including the Toyota Mirai , operate without humidifiers , relying on rapid water generation and the high rate of back - diffusion through thin membranes to maintain the hydration of the membrane , as well as the ionomer in the catalyst layers . High - temperature PEMFCs operate between 100 ° C and 200 ° C , potentially offering benefits to electrode kinetics and heat management , and better tolerance to fuel impurities , particularly CO in reformate . These improvements potentially could lead to higher overall system efficiencies . However , these gains have yet to be realized , as the gold - standard perfluorinated sulfonic acid ( PFSA ) membranes lose function rapidly at 100 ° C and above if hydration drops below ~ 100 % , and begin to creep in this temperature range , resulting in localized thinning and overall lower system lifetimes .

The flow of air becomes turbulent and a low - pressure zone is created , increasing drag and instability ( see Bernoulli effect ) . Adding a rear spoiler could be considered to make the air `` see '' a longer , gentler slope from the roof to the spoiler , which helps to delay flow separation and the higher pressure in front of the spoiler can help reduce the lift on the car by creating downforce .

{"q_id": 241196348015107315, "question": "where does the water go when a refrigerator defrost", "answer": " The defrost mechanism in a refrigerator heats the cooling element ( evaporator coil ) for a short period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it . The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit . Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer : For every 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 or 24 hours of compressor operation it turns on a defrost heater for 15 minutes to half an hour . The defrost heater , having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W , is mounted just below the evaporator in top - and bottom - freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side - by - side models . It may be protected from short circuits by means of fusible links . In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously . In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs , so the more the refrigerator door is closed , the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved . A defrost thermostat opens the heater circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature , 40 ° F ( 5 ° C ) or more , thereby preventing excessive heating of the freezer compartment . The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the defrost heater is on , but not both at the same time . ", "wiki_title": "Auto-defrost", "split": "train"}

{"q_id": 5406483940694475598, "question": "what does it mean when your eyes glow red in pictures", "answer": " In flash photography the light of the flash occurs too fast for the pupil to close , so much of the very bright light from the flash passes into the eye through the pupil , reflects off the fundus at the back of the eyeball and out through the pupil . The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals . The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils .

If the rainwater overflows the graduated inner cylinder , the larger outer container will catch it . When measurements are taken , the height of the water in the small graduated cylinder is measured , and the excess overflow in the large container is carefully poured into another graduated cylinder and measured to give the total rainfall . Sometimes a cone meter is used to prevent leakage that can result in alteration of the data . In locations using the metric system , the cylinder is usually marked in mm and will measure up to 250 millimetres ( 9.8 in ) of rainfall .

Under Rules 6.05 and 6.09 of the Official Rules of Major League Baseball , a batter becomes a runner when a third strike is not caught by the catcher with no runner on first base or when there are two outs . The strikeout is recorded , but the batter - runner must be tagged or forced out in order for the defensive team to register the out . Thus , it is possible for a pitcher to record more than three strikeouts in an inning . As a result of this rule , 88 different pitchers have struck out four batters in a half - inning of a Major League Baseball ( MLB ) game as of 2017 , the most recent being German Marquez of the Colorado Rockies on October 1 , 2018 . Four players -- Chuck Finley , A.J. Burnett , Zack Greinke , and Craig Kimbrel -- have accomplished the feat more than once in their career ; no player has ever struck out more than four batters in an inning .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration .

The central bank can either buy or sell government bonds in the open market ( this is where the name was historically derived from ) or , in what is now mostly the preferred solution , enter into a repo or secured lending transaction with a commercial bank : the central bank gives the money as a deposit for a defined period and synchronously takes an eligible asset as collateral . A central bank uses OMO as the primary means of implementing monetary policy . The usual aim of open market operations is -- aside from supplying commercial banks with liquidity and sometimes taking surplus liquidity from commercial banks -- to manipulate the short - term interest rate and the supply of base money in an economy , and thus indirectly control the total money supply , in effect expanding money or contracting the money supply . This involves meeting the demand of base money at the target interest rate by buying and selling government securities , or other financial instruments .

This speed change causes the light to be refracted and to enter the new medium at a different angle ( Huygens principle ) . The degree of bending of the light 's path depends on the angle that the incident beam of light makes with the surface , and on the ratio between the refractive indices of the two media ( Snell 's law ) . The refractive index of many materials ( such as glass ) varies with the wavelength or color of the light used , a phenomenon known as dispersion . This causes light of different colors to be refracted differently and to leave the prism at different angles , creating an effect similar to a rainbow . This can be used to separate a beam of white light into its constituent spectrum of colors . A similar separation happens with iridescent materials , such as a soap bubble . Prisms will generally disperse light over a much larger frequency bandwidth than diffraction gratings , making them useful for broad - spectrum spectroscopy .

{"q_id": 8223883650004263138, "question": "what is the new deal who created it and why is it significant", "answer": " The New Deal was a series of programs , public work projects , financial reforms and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1936 . It responded to needs for relief , reform and recovery from the Great Depression . Major federal programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps ( CCC ) , the Civil Works Administration ( CWA ) , the Farm Security Administration ( FSA ) , the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 ( NIRA ) and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) . They provided support for farmers , the unemployed , youth and the elderly . The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply . New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt . The programs focused on what historians refer to as the `` 3 Rs '' : relief for the unemployed and poor , recovery of the economy back to normal levels and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression . The New Deal produced a political realignment , making the Democratic Party the majority ( as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969 ) with its base in liberal ideas , the South , traditional Democrats , big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions and ethnic minorities . The Republicans were split , with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support . The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964 .

{"q_id": -427707378992352619, "question": "why we use three fingers to check pulse", "answer": " In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) .

{"q_id": 7142414188608973802, "question": "what effect will an increased angle of tilt have on the earth’s climate", "answer": " Perhaps one of the most apparent factors contributing to Earth climate change is the angle at which the earth is tilted . This is the angle at which Earth 's axis of rotation is from the vertical , also known as Earth 's obliquity . Earth 's current tilt angle is approximately 23.5 degrees . The axial tilt angle affects climate largely by determining which parts of the earth get more sunlight during different stages of the year . This is the primary cause for the different seasons Earth experiences throughout the year , as well as the intensity of the seasons for higher latitudes . For example , in the Northern Hemisphere , if there were no axial tilt , i.e. Earth 's obliquity would be zero degrees , then there would be no change in the seasons from year to year . This would be because there would be no difference in the amount of solar irradiation received , year - round , anywhere on Earth . On the other hand , if Earth 's axial tilt angle was great ( 45 + degrees ) , the seasonality of each hemisphere , individually , would be highly exaggerated . Summers would be extremely hot , with substantially more hours of daylight than night each day . Winters would be extremely cold , with substantially more hours of night than daylight each day . This is because , during summer for the northern hemisphere , if the earth is tilted more ( pointed towards the sun more ) , there would be more available hours in which the suns rays can strike any certain place , thereby increasing the number of daylight hours at any given place , with more and more daylight hours at higher latitudes . Also , because the northern hemisphere would be tilted much more towards the sun , it would be physically closer to the sun , thereby increasing the intensity of the sun 's rays hitting the northern hemisphere , thereby causing the northern hemisphere to become hotter . Likewise , during winter for the northern hemisphere , there would be fewer hours of daylight because the northern hemisphere would essentially be pointed away from the sun . Fewer daylight hours means less solar radiation hitting the northern hemisphere , especially at higher latitudes , and therefore causing the northern hemisphere to become colder . The same things can also be said about the southern hemisphere , particularly at high latitudes . In either case , the climate around the equator is not affected nearly as much as the higher latitudes , thereby creating a sizable difference in how obliquity affects different latitudes . This is all , of course , dependent on what the actual tilt angle is at any given point in time . The thing is , though , that Earth does in fact change obliquity over time in a cyclic pattern . Earth 's obliquity does not change much , though , as obliquity has been determined to cycle between the small range of 22.2 degrees to 24.5 degrees , in a cycle that lasts approximately 41,000 years . Therefore with the small tilt variation over time , the Earth has always been thought to have had a seasonal climate , at least in the high latitudes due to the solar affect of changing Earth obliquity .

Economic analysis of recycling does not include what economists call externalities , which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions . Examples include : decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration , reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills , reduced energy consumption , and reduced waste and resource consumption , which leads to a reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity .

In scientific contexts , mass refers loosely to the amount of `` matter '' in an object ( though `` matter '' may be difficult to define ) , whereas weight refers to the force exerted on an object by gravity . In other words , an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram will weigh approximately 9.81 newtons on the surface of the Earth ( its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength ) , since the newton is a unit of force , while the kilogram is a unit of mass . The object 's weight will be less on Mars ( where gravity is weaker ) , more on Saturn , and negligible in space when far from any significant source of gravity , but it will always have the same mass .

The noun in this sense is from 1755 . The term in the sense of `` to give a gratuity '' first appeared in the 18th century . It derived from an earlier sense of tip , meaning `` to give ; to hand , pass '' , which originated in the rogues ' cant in the 17th century . This sense may have derived from the 16th - century `` tip '' meaning `` to strike or hit smartly but lightly '' ( which may have derived from the Low German tippen , `` to tap '' ) but this derivation is `` very uncertain '' . The word `` tip '' was first used as a verb in 1707 in George Farquhar 's play The Beaux ' Stratagem .

Their position on the Earth 's surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries . There are two hypotheses that attempt to explain their origins . One suggests that hotspots are due to mantle plumes that rise as thermal diapirs from the core -- mantle boundary . The other hypothesis is that lithospheric extension permits the passive rising of melt from shallow depths .

In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues .

In this book , he gave 60 ' observations ' in detail of various objects under a coarse , compound microscope . One observation was from very thin slices of bottle cork . Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named `` cells '' . This came from the Latin word Cella , meaning ' a small room ' like monks lived in and also Cellulae , which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb .

With microscopes during this time having a low magnification , Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing . Therefore , he did not think the `` cellulae '' were alive . His cell observations gave no indication of the nucleus and other organelles found in most living cells . In Micrographia , Hooke also observed mould , bluish in color , found on leather . After studying it under his microscope , he was unable to observe `` seeds '' that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity .

As such , Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide ( Easter season ) . The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs , but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colored foil , hand - carved wooden eggs , or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate . However , real eggs continue to be used in Eastern European tradition . Although eggs , in general , were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth , in Christianity , for the celebration of Eastertide , Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus , from which Jesus resurrected . In addition , one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red `` in memory of the blood of Christ , shed as at that time of his crucifixion . '' This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia , and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches , and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches . This Christian use of eggs may have been influenced by practices in `` pre-dynastic period in Egypt , as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete '' .

{"q_id": -9140817331347585097, "question": "how does the process of frost wedging contribute to the weathering of rock", "answer": " The traditional explanation for frost weathering was volumetric expansion of freezing water . When water freezes to ice , its volume increases by nine percent . Under specific circumstances , this expansion is able to displace or fracture rock . At a temperature of - 22 ° C , ice growth is known to be able to generate pressures of up to 207 MPa , more than enough to fracture any rock . For frost weathering to occur by volumetric expansion , the rock must have almost no air that can be compressed to compensate for the expansion of ice , which means it has to be water - saturated and frozen quickly from all sides so that the water does not migrate away and the pressure is exerted on the rock . These conditions are considered unusual , restricting it to a process of importance within a few centimeters of a rock 's surface and on larger existing water - filled joints in a process called ice wedging .

Pie - weights are available as ceramic or metal beads , but rice , dried peas , lentils , beans or other pulses can be used instead . When using this method for a fully baked crust , the weights are removed before the pre-baking is complete in order to achieve a browned crust . Another technique dispenses with weights by placing a second pie tin on top of the crust , then inverting the tins to bake . In this method , the crust browns between the tins . A further simplified technique involves piercing the crust repeatedly with the tines of a fork to produce small holes , allowing steam to escape and preventing the crust from bubbling up , but that does not work with soft doughs such as pâte sucrée .

{"q_id": 8025962014352292796, "question": "why should we always treat all rational beings as ends and never merely as means", "answer": " Kant argued that rational beings can never be treated merely as means to ends ; they must always also be treated as ends themselves , requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected . This derives from Kant 's claim that reason motivates morality : it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings , including other people . A rational being can not rationally consent to being used merely as a means to an end , so they must always be treated as an end . Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity : that which is rationally willed is morally right . Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means , it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such .

The long and thin shape of root hairs maximizes surface area so that more water can enter . There is greater water potential in the soil than in the cytoplasm of the root hair cells . As the cell 's surface membrane of the root hair cell is semi-permeable , osmosis can take place ; and water passes from the soil to the root hairs . The next stage in the transpiration stream is water passing into the xylem vessels . The water either goes through the cortex cells ( between the root cells and the xylem vessels ) or it bypasses them -- going through their cell walls . After this , the water moves up the xylem vessels to the leaves through diffusion : A pressure change between the top and bottom of the vessel . Diffusion takes place because there is a water potential gradient between water in the xylem vessel and the leaf ( as water is transpiring out of the leaf ) . This means that water diffuses up the leaf . There is also a pressure change between the top and bottom of the xylem vessels , due to water loss from the leaves . This reduces the pressure of water at the top of the vessels . This means water moves up the vessels . The last stage in the transpiration stream is the water moving into the leaves , and then the actual transpiration . First , the water moves into the mesophyll cells from the top of the xylem vessels . Then the water evaporates out of the cells into the spaces between the cells in the leaf . After this , the water leaves the leaf ( and the whole plant ) by diffusion through stomata . ", "wiki_title": "Transpiration stream", "split": "train"}

'' The primary duties of the conductor are to interpret the score created by a composer in a manner which is reflective of the specific indications within that score , set the tempo , ensure correct entries by various members of the ensemble , and to `` shape '' the phrasing where appropriate . To convey their ideas and interpretation , conductors communicate with their musicians primarily through hand gestures , typically though not invariably with the aid of a baton , and may use other gestures or signals , such as eye contact with relevant performers . A conductor 's directions will almost invariably be supplemented or reinforced by verbal instructions or suggestions to their musicians in rehearsal prior to a performance .

It is based on common language descriptors . When factor analysis ( a statistical technique ) is applied to personality survey data , some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person . For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as `` always prepared '' rather than `` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors .

There was a cultural taboo that mothers not be buried pregnant , that may have reflected a way of saving some fetuses . Roman practice requiring a living mother to be in her tenth month of pregnancy before resorting to the procedure , reflecting the knowledge that she could not survive the delivery . Speculation that the Roman dictator Julius Caesar was born by the method now known as C - section is apparently false . Although Caesarean sections were performed in Roman times , no classical source records a mother surviving such a delivery . As late as the 12th century , scholar and physician Maimonides expresses doubt over the possibility of a woman 's surviving this procedure and again falling pregnant . The term has also been explained as deriving from the verb caedere , `` to cut '' , with children delivered this way referred to as caesones . Pliny the Elder refers to a certain Julius Caesar ( an ancestor of the famous Roman statesman ) as ab utero caeso , `` cut from the womb '' giving this as an explanation for the cognomen `` Caesar '' which was then carried by his descendants . Nonetheless , even if the etymological hypothesis linking the caesarean section to Julius Caesar is a false etymology , it has been widely believed . For example , the Oxford English Dictionary defines Caesarean birth as `` the delivery of a child by cutting through the walls of the abdomen when delivery can not take place in the natural way , as was done in the case of Julius Caesar '' .

Possible explanations for this include : ( 1 ) alterations in water balance caused by the stresses of captivity dietary changes , ( 2 ) lowered blood pressure due to reduced activity patterns , or ( 3 ) overheating of the collagen brought on by greater exposure of the fin to the ambient air . '' According to SeaWorld 's website , another reason for the fin to bend may be the greater amount of time that captive whales spend at the surface , where the fin is not supported by water pressure . The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dorsal fin collapse is largely explained by captive killer whales swimming in small circles due to the inadequate space in which they have to swim .

{"q_id": 4073599872996993190, "question": "what was the purpose of japan seizing manchuria", "answer": " The conquest of Manchuria , a land rich in natural resources , was widely seen as an economic `` lifeline '' to save Japan from the effects of the Great Depression , generating much public support . The American historian Louise Young described Japan from September 1931 to the spring of 1933 as gripped by `` war fever '' as the conquest of Manchuria proved to be an extremely popular war . The metaphor of a `` lifeline '' suggested that Manchuria was crucial to the functioning of the Japanese economy , which explains why the conquest of Manchuria was so popular and why afterwards Japanese public opinion was so hostile towards any suggestion of letting Manchuria go . At the time , censorship in Japan was nowhere near as stringent as it later became , and Young noted : `` Had they wished , it would have been possible in 1931 and 1932 for journalists and editors to express anti-war sentiments '' . The liberal journal Kaizō criticized the war with the journalist Gotō Shinobu in the November 1931 edition accusing the Kwangtung Army of a `` two-fold coup d'état '' against both the government in Tokyo and against the government of China . Voices like Kaizō were a minority as mainstream newspapers like the Asahi soon discovered that an anti-war editorial position hurt sales , and so switched over to an aggressively militaristic editorial position as the best way to increase sales . Japan 's most famous pacifist , the poet Akiko Yosano had caused a sensation in 1904 with her anti-war poem `` Brother Do Not Give Your Life '' , addressed to her younger brother serving in the Imperial Army that called the war with Russia stupid and senseless . Such was the extent of `` war fever '' in Japan in 1931 that even Akiko succumbed , writing a poem in 1932 praising bushidō , urging the Kwantung Army to `` smash the sissified dreams of compromise '' and declared that to die for the Emperor in battle was the most `` purest '' act a Japanese man could perform .

By the time of the late Middle Ages , the celebration of Shrovetide lasted until the start of Lent . Pancakes are commonly eaten on this day . Since foods such as butter , eggs and fat are discouraged from being eaten during the Lenten season , Christians use these ingredients during Shrovetide to make pancakes or other rich foods , such as fasnachts and pączkis . The specific custom of Christians eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday dates to the 16th century . Along with its emphasis on feasting , another theme of Shrove Tuesday involves Christians repenting of their sins in preparation to begin the season of Lent in the Christian calendar . In many Christian parish churches , both Protestant and Roman Catholic , a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells ( on this day , the toll is known as the Shriving Bell ) `` to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent '' and for people to `` begin frying their pancakes '' .

The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years . According to this theory , the nearly 60 ° bend where the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain meet was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific Plate . In 2003 , fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory , suggesting that hotspots are mobile , not fixed , and that the 47 - million - year - old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspot 's motion rather than the plate 's .

{"q_id": 4375996584910793984, "question": "what happens when mentos is put in coke", "answer": " The conversion of dissolved carbon dioxide to gaseous carbon dioxide forms rapidly expanding gas bubbles in the soda , which pushes the beverage contents out of the container . Gasses , in general , are more soluble in liquids at elevated pressures . Carbonated sodas contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide under pressure . The solution becomes supersaturated with carbon dioxide when the bottle is opened , and the pressure is released . Under these conditions , carbon dioxide begins to precipitate from solution , forming gas bubbles . Normally , this process is relatively slow , because the activation energy for this process is high . The activation energy for a process like bubble nucleation depends on where the bubble forms . It is highest for bubbles that form in the liquid itself ( homogeneous nucleation ) , and lower if the bubble forms on some other surface ( heterogeneous nucleation ) . When the pressure is released from a soda bottle , the bubbles tend to form on the sides of the bottle . But because they are smooth and clean , the activation energy is still relatively high , and the process is slow . The addition of other nucleation sites provides an alternative pathway for the reaction to occur with lower activation energy , much like a catalyst . For instance dropping grains of salt or sand into the solution lowers the activation energy , and increases the rate of carbon dioxide precipitation . The physical characteristics of Mentos ( surface roughness , easy dissolution into the liquid , etc . ) have the effect of drastically reducing the activation energy for carbon dioxide bubble formation , so that the nucleation rate becomes exceedingly high . The activation energy for the release of carbon dioxide from Diet Coke by addition of Mentos has been found to be 25 kJ mol . This formation of gaseous carbon dioxide within the water , which due to hydrogen bonding and its high surface tension wants to maintain a connected matrix of molecules , causes the water to foam , ultimately generating the `` jet '' -- or `` geyser '' -- or eruption - like nature of the effusion . The foaming is aided by the presence of chemicals like potassium benzoate and aspartame in Diet Coke , and gelatin and gum arabic in the Mentos candy , all which influence the nature of water 's surface tension and degree to which it can foam .

{"q_id": 7930430986561811753, "question": "o why is memory considered an active reconstructive process", "answer": " Memory is never a literal recount of past experiences . Rather , it is dependent on the constructive processes present at the time of encoding that are subject to potential errors and distortions . Essentially , the constructive memory process functions by encoding the patterns of physical characteristics that are perceived by the individual , as well as the interpretive conceptual and semantic functions that act in response to the incoming information . By utilizing multiple interdependent cognitive processes there is never a single location in the brain where a given complete memory trace of an experience is stored . In this manner , the various features of the experience must be joined together to form a coherent representation of the episode and if this binding process fails it can result in source memory failure , where later attempted retrieval of the episode results in fragmented recollection and an inability to consolidate the information into a cohesive narrative of a past experience . During the recall of Episodic memory , the information that a person remembers is usually limited in scope , ultimately giving an incomplete recollection of an event .

This reflected Hungary 's general attitude towards the communist satellite setup : popular opinion was against communism , and Hungarians wanted independence . With Gorbachev 's new policy towards the satellites of not using military action in the satellite states , and general sovereignty within the confines of each individual country , popular public opinion was necessary .

When moving quickly , the lizard can cross a surface of water before sinking . On water , it runs an average speed of 8.4 km / h ( or 5.2 mph ) , which is just a little slower than its speed on land . Younger basilisks can run 10 to 20 meters on water , while adults cross only a few meters before sinking . Adults do not move slowly , but they weigh more and can not sprint for as long a time . Once a basilisk submerges , it continues swimming until it is sufficiently far from its pursuer -- if the predator has followed past the bank .

The poem was published under the title `` The Chariot '' . It is composed in six quatrains with the meter alternating between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter . Stanzas 1 , 2 , 4 , and 6 employ end rhyme in their second and fourth lines , but some of these are only close rhyme or eye rhyme . In the third stanza , there is no end rhyme , but `` ring '' in line 2 rhymes with `` gazing '' and `` setting '' in lines 3 and 4 respectively . Internal rhyme is scattered throughout . Figures of speech include alliteration , anaphora , paradox , and personification . The poem personifies Death as a gentleman caller who takes a leisurely carriage ride with the poet to her grave . She also personifies immortality . The volta ( turn ) happens in the fourth quatrain . Structurally , the syllables shift from its constant 8 - 6 - 8 - 6 scheme to 6 - 8 - 8 - 6 . This parallels with the undertones of the sixth quatrain . The personification of death changes from one of pleasantry to one of ambiguity and morbidity : `` Or rather -- He passed Us -- / The Dews drew quivering and chill -- '' ( 13 - 14 ) .

Charles Darrow drew the designs with a drafting pen on round pieces of oilcloth , and then his son and his wife helped fill in the spaces with colors and make the title deed cards and the Chance cards and Community Chest cards . After the demand for the game increased , Darrow contacted a printing company , Patterson and White , which printed the designs of the property spaces on square carton boards . Darrow 's game board designs included elements later made famous in the version eventually produced by Parker Brothers , including black locomotives on the railroad spaces , the car on `` Free Parking '' , the red arrow for `` Go '' , the faucet on `` Water Works '' , the light bulb on `` Electric Company '' , and the question marks on the `` Chance '' spaces , though many of the actual icons were created by a hired graphic artist . While Darrow received a copyright on his game in 1933 , its specimens have disappeared from the files of the United States Copyright Office , though proof of its registration remains .

Interphase is the ' daily living ' or metabolic phase of the cell , in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them , grows , reads its DNA , and conducts other `` normal '' cell functions . The majority of eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase . This phase was formerly called the resting phase . However , interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting ; rather , the cell is living , and preparing for later cell division , so the name was changed . A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis . However , since mitosis is the division of the nucleus , prophase is actually the first stage .

Since the transport ships needed to bring American troops to Europe were scarce at the beginning , the U.S. Army pressed into service passenger liners , seized German ships , and borrowed Allied ships to transport American soldiers from ports in New York City , New Jersey , and Virginia . The mobilization effort taxed the American military to the limit and required new organizational strategies and command structures to transport great numbers of troops and supplies quickly and efficiently . The French harbors of Bordeaux , La Pallice , Saint Nazaire , and Brest became the entry points into the French railway system that brought the American troops and their supplies to the Western Front .

The word `` cactus '' derives , through Latin , from the Ancient Greek κάκτος , kaktos , a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is not certain . Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes . Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought . Many live in extremely dry environments , even being found in the Atacama Desert , one of the driest places on earth . Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water . Almost all cacti are succulents , meaning they have thickened , fleshy parts adapted to store water . Unlike many other succulents , the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place . Most species of cacti have lost true leaves , retaining only spines , which are highly modified leaves . As well as defending against herbivores , spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade . In the absence of leaves , enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis .

This process determines which activities are `` critical '' ( i.e. , on the longest path ) and which have `` total float '' ( i.e. , can be delayed without making the project longer ) . In project management , a critical path is the sequence of project network activities which add up to the longest overall duration , regardless if that longest duration has float or not . This determines the shortest time possible to complete the project . There can be ' total float ' ( unused time ) within the critical path . For example , if a project is testing a solar panel and task ' B ' requires ' sunrise ' , there could be a scheduling constraint on the testing activity so that it would not start until the scheduled time for sunrise . This might insert dead time ( total float ) into the schedule on the activities on that path prior to the sunrise due to needing to wait for this event . This path , with the constraint - generated total float would actually make the path longer , with total float being part of the shortest possible duration for the overall project . In other words , individual tasks on the critical path prior to the constraint might be able to be delayed without elongating the critical path ; this is the ' total float ' of that task .

In 1868 , the number of seats was fixed at 533 , and this number was increased several times over the years . In 1953 , the number of seats was set at 1,366 . These seats were a sought - after commodity as they conferred the ability to directly trade stock on the NYSE , and seat holders were commonly referred to as members of the NYSE . The Barnes family is the only known lineage to have five generations of NYSE members : Winthrop H. Barnes ( admitted 1894 ) , Richard W.P. Barnes ( admitted 1926 ) , Richard S. Barnes ( admitted 1951 ) , Robert H. Barnes ( admitted 1972 ) , Derek J. Barnes ( admitted 2003 ) . Seat prices varied widely over the years , generally falling during recessions and rising during economic expansions . The most expensive inflation - adjusted seat was sold in 1929 for $625,000 , which , today , would be over six million dollars . In recent times , seats have sold for as high as $4 million in the late 1990s and as low as $1 million in 2001 .

On 28 August 1947 , the Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution , with Dr BR Ambedkar as chairman . While India 's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule , the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution .

Its use , by the enemies of France , dates to this period , originally a pun to make fun of the French , the association between the rooster and the Gauls / French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents : prior to being arrested , Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning . At the rooster 's crowing , Peter remembered Jesus 's words . Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil . It is also an emblem of the Christian 's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ , the resurrection of the dead , and the final judgment of humankind .

The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a Commonwealth prime ministers ' meeting in London . Under the London Declaration , India agreed that , when it became a republic in January 1950 , it would accept the British Sovereign as a `` symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth '' . Upon hearing this , King George VI told the Indian politician Krishna Menon : `` So , I 've become ' as such ' '' . The other Commonwealth countries recognised India 's continuing membership of the association . At Pakistan 's insistence , India was not regarded as an exceptional case and it was assumed that other states would be accorded the same treatment as India .  Ireland had withdrawn its participation in the Commonwealth in the 1930s , attending its last Commonwealth governmental heads ' meeting in 1932 . However it continued to be regarded by the Commonwealth as a Commonwealth member until it declared itself a republic , on 18 April 1949 .

The name comes from the idea that on a graph of concentration versus time , the line forms a U-shaped trough at the lowest region , before a new dose sends it higher again . The usual criterion is concentration in the blood serum , although in some instances local concentration within tissues is relevant . It is pharmacokinetically normal that with every passing minute and hour , the drug molecules are being metabolized or cleared by the body , so the concentration of drug that remains available is dropping . In a medicine that is administered periodically , the trough level should be measured just before the administration of the next dose in order to avoid overdosing . A trough level is contrasted with a `` peak level '' , which is the highest level of the medicine in the body , and the `` average level '' , which is the mean level over time .

A mantle plume is an upwelling of abnormally hot rock within the Earth 's mantle , first proposed by J. Tuzo Wilson in 1963 . As the heads of mantle plumes can partly melt when they reach shallow depths , they are often invoked as the cause of volcanic hotspots , such as Hawaii or Iceland , and flood basalts such as the Deccan and Siberian traps . Some such volcanic regions lie far from tectonic plate boundaries , while others represent unusually large - volume volcanism near plate boundaries or in large igneous provinces .

However , as William Bright noted the word `` chocolatl '' does n't occur in central Mexican colonial sources making this an unlikely derivation .

The word `` xocolatl '' does not appear in Molina 's dictionary .  Cultivation , consumption , and cultural use of cacao were extensive in Mesoamerica where the cacao tree is native .

{"q_id": -1285618560083986250, "question": "what does the advent of behavioral modernity refer to", "answer": " Behavioral modernity is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current Homo sapiens from other anatomically modern humans , hominins , and primates . Although often debated , most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking , planning depth , symbolic behavior ( e.g. , art , ornamentation , music ) , exploitation of large game , and blade technology , among others . Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically . Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation , social norms , language , and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin . It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits , in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum , was largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals and the peopling of the rest of the world .

{"q_id": -8602381519038886159, "question": "what happens at the end of where the wild things are", "answer": " Max finds Alexander alone in the fort and has a conversation with him . Alexander reveals that he always suspected that Max is not a king with magical powers , but warns him to never let Carol know . Soon enough , at pre-dawn , Carol throws another tantrum -- this time , about the fort , K.W. 's absence , and the eventual death of the sun ( which Max had talked to Carol about earlier in the film ) . When Carol gets angry with Max for not doing a good job as a king , Douglas tries to explain to him that he 's `` just a boy , pretending to be a wolf , pretending to be a king '' , thus exposing the truth to the rest of the Wild Things . Carol becomes enraged and ends up ripping off Douglas 's right arm ( though only sand pours out of the wound ) . Then he chases Max into the forest and attempts to eat him . Max is saved by K.W. , who hides him in her stomach . Max listens as Carol and K.W. have an argument over Carol 's misbehavior . Max finds the crushed remains of Carol 's model island ( presumably destroyed by Carol himself in a rage ) and leaves a token of affection for him to find ( a letter C inside a love heart made of twigs ) . He finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king . The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat . Carol runs to join them after finding Max 's token and arrives in time to see him off . He starts to howl and Max howls back , then all the other Wild Things join in . Carol looks at K.W. and she smiles kindly at him . Returning home , Max is embraced by his distraught mother , who gives him a bowl of hot soup , a piece of cake and a glass of milk and sits with him as he eats . He watches as she falls asleep .
