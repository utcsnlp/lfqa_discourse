The spark that led to a mutiny in several sepoy companies was the issue of new gunpowder cartridges for the Enfield rifle in February , 1857 . A rumour was spread that the cartridges were made from cow and pig fat . Loading the Enfield required tearing open the greased cartridge with one 's teeth . This would have insulted both Hindu and Muslim religious practices ; cows were considered holy by Hindus while pigs were considered unclean by Muslims . Underlying grievances over British taxation and recent land annexations by the BEIC were ignited by the sepoy mutineers and within weeks dozens of units of the Indian army joined peasant armies in widespread rebellion . The old aristocracy , both Muslim and Hindu , who were seeing their power steadily eroded by the East India Company , also rebelled against British rule .

In fact, you even have a gravitational force. As the distance to a planet or star gets smaller, its gravitational pull gets stronger. Since the meteor already has a velocity vector (a magnitude and direction) it begins to accelerate towards the planet and it changes direction. So the meteor is still flying in its original direction and speed but now it's being pulled in another direction with additional speed. There are no fixed points in space so an object can't fly directly to a point. Every time it passes anything in space with mass it will move slightly towards it, depending on how much mass the meteor has and how much mass the object has. Imagine you're driving down a straight road doing 75 mph and ahead of you on the side of the road is a powerful magnet. As you get closer to passing the magnet, it's going to pull you towards it.

The economic philosophy (also called mercantilism) was at its height during the Industrial Revolution and is the basis of liberal-democratic policies in many countries. Countries that became socialist during the 19th century were generally very liberal in economic policy (with a large emphasis on worker's rights) as opposed to the left-wing movements they developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. As you can see from this paper, the government of Britain is also a liberal in economic policy and the former socialist regimes were fairly conservative in their economic policies. As a result of these two reasons a lot of people mistakenly identify themselves as liberal.

Nutrition certainly plays a role on this too, but some differences between countries from similar regions can't be explained by that. Sami people for example (the only indigenous people of Europe) seem to be significantly shorter regardless of living in Northern Europe (for the longest). Or other speakers of the Finno-Ugric language family, despite living relatively North are shorter than their neighbors. Presumably due to genetic differences, since they're not as closely related to other Europeans.

Why this is the case is up for debate but the mechanism at work here is that new nerve cells can follow this ever-decreasing electrical signal so they know where to go.

These neutrons are usually moving too fast to actually be absorbed by the fuel normally, but they do travel into a moderator (usually water because it is stable and doubles as a coolant) that can slow them down by letting the neutrons bounce around a bit, transferring the energy to the moderator molecules in the form of heat. When these neutrons have slowed enough, they are considered \u201cthermalized\u201d and they drift back into the fuel region and are able to be absorbed by the fissionable material which destabilizes it, causing fission which releases a lot more fast neutrons that go and do the same thing. The heat generated by the neutron in the moderator is transferred to a coolant (if they aren't the same thing) and can either cause boiling in the core (such as with a boiling water reactor) or is transferred to a lower pressure system through a heat exchanger called a steam generator which causes boiling in this secondary system (in a Pressurized Water Reactor). The high pressure steam is then sent through a turbine that spins to generate electricity. Any leftover low pressure steam after the turbine has the excess heat transferred out into an outside source of water (coolant tower, lake, river, ocean, etc.) through another heat exchanger called a condenser. The condensed water is then pumped back into the Reactor core or Steam Generator to repeat the process. Each system is self-enclosed and the water never mixes. The neutron creation in the core is controlled by using moveable control rods made out of a material that can absorb neutrons such as boron or by chemically adding the neutron absorber to the core in controlled amounts. The amount of neutron absorber added or Control Rod movement will control exactly how many neutrons are absorbed, preventing them from going back into the core to create more fissions which directly control the heat generated by the reactor, thus the power generated. tl;dr: Hot core creates steam which pushes a turbine around which generates power.

Unlike a lot of other diseases it does not have an obvious cure, so if your body can't fight it off you're left with your life in the hands of an incurable virus. Also it is usually transmitted through bodily fluids. This is a result of the higher mortality rates caused by Ebola. The amount of victims compared to the number of victims of other diseases makes it a greater deal of a stressor. The death toll of Ebola is high, so it's only natural that more people suffer from it. Also it was originally a disease that was primarily confined to Africa.

For instance , if normal - phase silica gel is used as the stationary phase , it can be considered polar . Given two compounds that differ in polarity , the more polar compound has a stronger interaction with the silica and is , therefore , better able to displace the mobile phase from the available binding sites . As a consequence , the less polar compound moves higher up the plate ( resulting in a higher R value ) . If the mobile phase is changed to a more polar solvent or mixture of solvents , it becomes better at binding to the polar plate and therefore displacing solutes from it , so all compounds on the TLC plate will move higher up the plate . It is commonly said that `` strong '' solvents ( eluents ) push the analyzed compounds up the plate , whereas `` weak '' eluents barely move them . The order of strength / weakness depends on the coating ( stationary phase ) of the TLC plate .

For C18 - coated plates the order is reverse . In other words , when the stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is non-polar , the method is normal - phase as opposed to reverse - phase . This means that if a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane as the mobile phase is used , adding more ethyl acetate results in higher R values for all compounds on the TLC plate . Changing the polarity of the mobile phase will normally not result in reversed order of running of the compounds on the TLC plate .

While google might be happy to help a lot of people, it still cares only about the impression their product (which it's highly paid to produce) makes on a certain segment of the public.

It is not inherently radioactive, but it is highly radioactive and has a very long half-life. The dangers of radioactive energy are a couple of things: radiation, and the potential for damage to the environment. The dangers of radiation are primarily due to the radiation emitted by the sun, which is a very small amount. The radiation from the sun is about the same as the radiation emitted by a campfire, and it is about the same as a nuclear reactor. So there is very little radiation from the sun to worry about, and it is not a problem to have a nuclear reactor, because there is no radioactive waste that would be emitted by the reactor. However, the radiation from the sun is very dangerous because it is very high energy, and it can cause damage to the environment.

First is that Social Security and its trust fund are the same thing. For decades, SS was taking it more money than it was paying out, so the surplus was invested in treasury bonds - that's the trust fund. Depending on how you calculate things, we either just passed, or are about to pass, the point where SS is paying out more than it's taking in, so the program has to start taking from the trust fund to cover current benefit levels. If nothing is changed, we'll completely deplete the trust fund in 25 years or so. However, people will still be paying payroll taxes towards SS, so the program won't have run out of money.\n\nThe second misconception seems to be that retirees are guaranteed certain benefit levels, so once the trust fund runs out, they'll still be entitled to the same amount of money, and we'll either have to borrow money from somewhere to keep the program going, or SS will have to go bankrupt.
