For example you can share a similar face through inheriting different set of genes. So \"external\" similarity doesn't necessarily imply shared ancestry. Height for example is a multifactorial trait which depends among other things on nutrition, it's hard to say you **aren't** related to someone because he/she hasn't the same height. \n\nOther backdraw, since you inherit half of your genetic material from one of your parents it's hard to trace certain traits like \"oh he has that kind of nose or hair* we have something in common\" (without having the pedigree of both subjects you are comparing). Maybe he inherited those traits from a russian father while you got them thanks to your irish mother instead of your russian father.\n\nAlso, -broadly speaking- the same genes are present in most of the populations or ethnicities, the diversity is derived from the frequency of said alleles (or variants within the genes) within the populations. In such way the sampling ~~bias~~ might affect your conclusions (If by chance you are in front of one of the few redhead from population X that hasn't anything to do with a shared origin with that subject).\n\n**Edit #2** There is no huge amount of genes that determine the physical appearance. And said gene/traits are the blank of strong sexual selection (let's say you prefer wide hips now).

Each song will have the same basic scale in order for it to sound pleasing to the ear or, in the right key. Your basic key for music is the key of C, which employs the notes C through G and back to B again, naturally with no \"sharps\" or \"flats.\" These scales can be offset starting with a different note other than C. After this is done, the pattern of sound differences must be carried over to the new notes by using sharps and flats.

I know California and Indiana your child can attend a state school for a certain amount of credit hours (in Indiana where I live it's enough to get a Bachelors), but you often have to have a disability rating--not necessarily a Purple Heart of Medal of Honor.

In principle , Easter falls on the Sunday following the full moon that follows the northern spring equinox ( the paschal full moon ) . However , the vernal equinox and the full moon are not determined by astronomical observation . The vernal equinox is fixed to fall on 21 March ( previously it varied in different areas and in some areas Easter was allowed to fall before the equinox ) . The full moon is an ecclesiastical full moon determined by reference to a lunar calendar , which again varied in different areas . While Easter now falls at the earliest on the 15th of the lunar month and at the latest on the 21st , in some areas it used to fall at the earliest on the 14th ( the day of the paschal full moon ) and at the latest on the 20th , or between the sixteenth and the 22nd . The last limit arises from the fact that the crucifixion was considered to have happened on the 14th ( the eve of the Passover ) and the resurrection therefore on the sixteenth . The `` computus '' is the procedure of determining the first Sunday after the first ecclesiastical full moon falling on or after 21 March , and the difficulty arose from doing this over the span of centuries without accurate means of measuring the precise tropical year .

The camera records this reflected light . The main cause of the red color is the ample amount of blood in the choroid which nourishes the back of the eye and is located behind the retina . The blood in the retinal circulation is far less than in the choroid , and plays virtually no role . The eye contains several photostable pigments that all absorb in the short wavelength region , and hence contribute somewhat to the red eye effect . The lens cuts off deep blue and violet light , below 430 nm ( depending on age ) , and macular pigment absorbs between 400 and 500 nm , but this pigment is located exclusively in the tiny fovea . Melanin , located in the retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) and the choroid , shows a gradually increasing absorption towards the short wavelengths . But blood is the main determinant of the red color , because it is completely transparent at long wavelengths and abruptly starts absorbing at 600 nm . The amount of red light emerging from the pupil depends on the amount of melanin in the layers behind the retina . This amount varies strongly between individuals . Light skinned people with blue eyes have relatively low melanin in the fundus and thus show a much stronger red - eye effect than dark skinned people with brown eyes . The same holds for animals . The color of the iris itself is of virtually no importance for the red - eye effect . This is obvious because the red - eye effect is most apparent when photographing dark adapted subjects , hence with fully dilated pupils .

Immediately after the earthquake , the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions . However , the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the reactors .

{"dataset": "ELI5", "question": "What happens if I inject a needle(medicine, drugs, etc) into myself and it isn't into a vein? For example into my palm, or in a random place on my arm.", "q_id": "3wunwb", "a_id": "cxzimz9", "answer_paragraph": "MD here. Lots of medications are meant to be injected either under the skin into the fatty tissue (subcutaneous/SC) or into muscle tissue (intramuscular/IM). For example, insulin and some blood thinners are injected SC, while most vaccines are given IM. A lot of medications can be given either intravenously (IV) or IM or SC. The main difference with the SC/IM routes is that the drug will be absorbed into the bloodstream more slowly, which may be preferable in certain situations. However, other medications can be disastrous if they leak out of a vein (\"extravasate\"). These are often highly concentrated, hyperosmolar solutions such as hypertonic saline, calcium chloride, or the IV contrast used for CT scans. The result is often necrosis (death) of the affected tissue, pain, swelling, and compartment syndrome, which can cut off blood supply to the affected extremity and lead to amputations. When it comes to recreational drugs like heroin, the intensity of the \"high\" is relative to how fast the drug gets into the brain. Injecting into a vein, therefore, is going to deliver the drug to the brain in a high concentration within seconds, with the resulting \"rush\" that IV heroin users are chasing. If you miss the vein, the heroin is probably going IM or SC, so it will get into the bloodstream, and the brain, more slowly, with a less intense high.

{"dataset": "ELI5", "question": "How a nuclear reactor works to produce energy.", "q_id": "4gjagn", "a_id": "d2i17um", "answer_paragraph": "Nuclear reactors use fissionable materials (Usually Uranium or Plutonium) that emit “fast” neutrons naturally through radioactive decay. These neutrons are usually moving too fast to actually be absorbed by the fuel normally, but they do travel into a moderator (usually water because it is stable and doubles as a coolant) that can slow them down by letting the neutrons bounce around a bit, transferring the energy to the moderator molecules in the form of heat. When these neutrons have slowed enough, they are considered “thermalized” and they drift back into the fuel region and are able to be absorbed by the fissionable material which destabilizes it, causing fission which releases a lot more fast neutrons that go and do the same thing. The heat generated by the neutron in the moderator is transferred to a coolant (if they aren't the same thing) and can either cause boiling in the core (such as with a boiling water reactor) or is transferred to a lower pressure system through a heat exchanger called a steam generator which causes boiling in this secondary system (in a Pressurized Water Reactor). The high pressure steam is then sent through a turbine that spins to generate electricity. Any leftover low pressure steam after the turbine has the excess heat transferred out into an outside source of water (coolant tower, lake, river, ocean, etc.) through another heat exchanger called a condenser. The condensed water is then pumped back into the Reactor core or Steam Generator to repeat the process. Each system is self-enclosed and the water never mixes. The neutron creation in the core is controlled by using moveable control rods made out of a material that can absorb neutrons such as boron or by chemically adding the neutron absorber to the core in controlled amounts. The amount of neutron absorber added or Control Rod movement will control exactly how many neutrons are absorbed, preventing them from going back into the core to create more fissions which directly control the heat generated by the reactor, thus the power generated. tl;dr: Hot core creates steam which pushes a turbine around which generates power.

{"dataset": "ELI5", "question": "How do airlines outside of the United States provide such a great experience at a lower cost than those in the U.S.?", "q_id": "5oue1p", "a_id": "dcm7x7q", "answer_paragraph": "There are a number of reasons. First, labor is far cheaper in Asia than in the US. The cost of labor is about the same as the cost for fuel for airlines in the US, at around 30% of total airline costs. By contrast, it is usually around 15% for Asian airlines, with fuel being almost 40% of their costs. Second, many Asian airlines are state owned or heavily subsidized by the state. Those states recognize that bringing in people to spend money in their country benefits them. By contrast, airlines in the US are (mostly) privately owned and only benefit by taking you from place to place. Once you step off the plane, they don't get more money out of you until you get back on. Third, the people who fly on Asian airlines tend to be upper class citizens.

Higher ceilings allow more time for smoke and heat to accumulate before affecting things closer to the floor (e.g., people, fire load/combustibles). The height also can allow for fire suppression systems that cover a greater area with fewer components, such as sprinkler heads. In addition, it is generally easier to control the climate in a larger space with larger air volumes (exchanges per hour) that are not as noticeable in one spot. (Except for those annoying freeze-or-fry areas where air flows are concentrated.) The air handlers in these systems can also be configured for use following a fire to assist in evacuating smoke from a building, either by exhaust or pressurizing the building (negative and positive pressure ventilation, respectively). Construction costs would tend to be slightly higher because of the longer (higher) columns required, which in turn need to be stronger because of (typically) larger roof systems such as bar joists or trusses. Such costs can be somewhat offset by reducing the number of columns required. When designers are tasked to create 'open space', regardless of low or high ceilings, larger columns with stronger roof systems allow column spacing to be increased, thus 'opening' the space. However, this is not always the case, such as in multi-story structures where significant weight/loads on higher floors require different column sizes or spacing (e.g., airports, parking ramps, hotels). Operating costs do tend to be higher, but it is a trade off on the desired space/affect and what is considered reasonable operating expense. Such factors are taken into consideration during the design phase of projects, so the owner/operator knows early-on what to expect.

In a more definitive approach, courts presume harm from speech in cases involving discrimination or sexual harassment. While the original justification for these obscenity laws was predicated on an unfounded assumption that speech can deprave or corrupt children, and it is important to note that there is little (if any) social science data demonstrating that a word is by itself harmful, it is also pertinent to consider the origin of some derogatory words and the context of their usage to understand why they should be unacceptable in social settings. Examples include:\n-Ape/Monkey: These are considered offensive terms when used to describe a person of color because offensive comparisons of black people to apes date back hundreds of centuries, such as when scientists Josiah C. Nott and George R. Gliddon created the 1854 Types of Mankind (a leading scientific text on race in its time), and they compared black people not to other (white) people but to chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans.

One theory is that, when the solar system formed from gas and space dust particles, the space dust formed clumps that became planets. The remaining dust formed moons around some planets, but it was too close to other planets to form stable bodies and formed rings instead. Another idea relates to the planets' proximity to the sun. It's possible that rings, being made of frozen dust, couldn't form on planets closer to the heat of the sun. Some scientists have proposed that the gravitational pull of a planet is the reason for rings or moons. If dust was close to the planet when it formed, the gravitational pull was too strong for the dust to gather into a moon, so it dispersed into a wider ring. A nearby moon or comet driving the planet's gravitational forces could also have interrupted the dust forming a moon and causing it to spread into a ring. One last theory is that the giant planets had the mass and gravity to form miniature solar-system-like disks around themselves and pull in passing objects as irregular moons to form an eccentric ring instead of a system of moons with stable orbits.

The speed limit of a plane is based on the amount of air the plane needs to push off of to move at a constant speed. Air resistance increases with speed, so at the speeds that planes fly, there will always be a point where the maximum amount of air can be pushed off of the plane by the engine without it damaging the plane. So as long as the plane can push enough air off of the engine and the plane has enough fuel to push enough air off the plane, it will be fine at cruising speed. The thing to remember is, even at cruising speed, air resistance has to be overcome. This is why you have a climbing wind at high altitudes as you gain speed.

{"dataset": "ELI5_MODEL", "question": "Why does the word 'liberal' refer to the left in the US?", "q_id": "1ihljt", "a_id": "p90_predicted", "answer_paragraph": "Generally speaking the left-wing comes from classical liberalism. The economic philosophy (also called mercantilism) was at its height during the Industrial Revolution and is the basis of liberal-democratic policies in many countries. Countries that became socialist during the 19th century were generally very liberal in economic policy (with a large emphasis on worker's rights) as opposed to the left-wing movements they developed during the 18th and 19th centuries. As you can see from this paper, the government of Britain is also a liberal in economic policy and the former socialist regimes were fairly conservative in their economic policies. As a result of these two reasons a lot of people mistakenly identify themselves as liberal.

You can make a soup out of a soup, but you can't create a soup out of nothing. The soup comes from the soup, and the soup comes from the soup, and the soup comes from the soup, and so on. In this case, matter comes from the universe and is part of the universe.

There's no way for matter to be created out of nothing, and that's where the word \"can\" comes from.

I'm not sure I can ELI5, but I'll try. I think it's partly because women's sports are less popular in general, whereas men's sports are more popular. It's a combination of things like more women entering the sport (more women coming to the professional level), less access to sports venues (less available access to facilities), and more money spent on sporting events (more money spent on prizes, more money spent on travel). As a result, women's sports have fewer people watching them, and therefore less viewers.

Normally, the odds are very low that anything large will be flying in front of the ISS. The risk is actually fairly small. They spend some time in microgravity pools to make sure nothing that big gets sucked in. Finally, they are required to take in a small amount of water each time they take off to ensure that it does not put any on the controls. That said, a meteor would most certainly be out there waiting to be hit. If the whole ISS was randomly flying away from the Earth every time it took off, something small would be launched at it. The chances of hitting a chunk of debris that size is extremely low. That's why they don't do a lot of observation during the daytime, in case something really big is flying at them. It would be pretty rare for a meteor to hit the ISS at night if they didn't have to take in water to protect the craft.

{"dataset": "ELI5_MODEL", "question": "What caused racial division and discrimination between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda?", "q_id": "5fpy11", "a_id": "p90_random", "answer_paragraph": "Hutus are an African ethnic group that arrived in Africa in the early bronze age. Some believe they came because of disease and other evolutionary reasons. They were pretty much isolated from Tutsis and the Tutsi came from the north and spread further north. They were also subject to different environmental conditions and had less access to the resources and methods of hunting which allowed them to stay much poorer than the other ethnic groups. When the europeans arrived, they both mixed and evolved, although the differences between the two groups were greatly reduced because they are now largely homogeneous. The current hatred for Tutsis is due to their lack of identification with western culture and learning of western practices, also they are heavily reduced in wealth and status which results in resentment from their more privileged counterparts. A bias exists towards the Hutus because they are stereotyped as uncivilized, but they have historically been very highly educated, leading to a lot of the theories about why they are viewed as so uncivilized. Tutsis are not as concentrated in Africa as the other two ethnic groups, they are mainly found in South America, Central and South America. The same goes for other groups that are seen as much more isolationist in the US and Europe.", "answer_sentences": ["Hutus are an African ethnic group that arrived in Africa in the early bronze age.", "Some believe they came because of disease and other evolutionary reasons.", "They were pretty much isolated from Tutsis and the Tutsi came from the north and spread further north.", "They were also subject to different environmental conditions and had less access to the resources and methods of hunting which allowed them to stay much poorer than the other ethnic groups.", "When the europeans arrived, they both mixed and evolved, although the differences between the two groups were greatly reduced because they are now largely homogeneous.", "The current hatred for Tutsis is due to their lack of identification with western culture and learning of western practices, also they are heavily reduced in wealth and status which results in resentment from their more privileged counterparts.", "A bias exists towards the Hutus because they are stereotyped as uncivilized, but they have historically been very highly educated, leading to a lot of the theories about why they are viewed as so uncivilized.", "Tutsis are not as concentrated in Africa as the other two ethnic groups, they are mainly found in South America, Central and South America.", "The same goes for other groups that are seen as much more isolationist in the US and Europe."], "role_annotation": ["Auxiliary Information", "Auxiliary Information", "Answer", "", "Auxiliary Information", "Answer (Summary)", "Answer (Summary)", "Auxiliary Information", "Auxiliary Information"], "raw_role_annotation": [["Auxiliary Information", "Auxiliary Information", "Answer"], ["Auxiliary Information", "Auxiliary Information", "Auxiliary Information"], ["Answer", "Auxiliary Information", "Answer"], ["Answer", "Auxiliary Information", "Answer (Summary)"], ["Auxiliary Information", "Auxiliary Information", "Answer (Summary)"], ["Answer (Summary)", "Answer (Summary)", "Answer (Summary)"], ["Answer (Summary)", "Answer (Summary)", "Answer (Summary)"], ["Auxiliary Information", "Answer", "Auxiliary Information"], ["Auxiliary Information", "Answer", "Auxiliary Information"]], "type": "role"}
